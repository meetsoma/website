# Quality Standards

Guardrails for safe, reliable work. These protect against destructive operations and sloppy git hygiene. Verification lives in tool-discipline. Pattern recognition lives in pattern-evolution.

## TL;DR

Never delete — move or archive. Clean atomic commits with descriptive messages. Push when ready. Know which branch deploys. Confirm before touching critical files. Close the loop — when fixing a bug, fix the system that allowed it. Tests match shipped code, not planned features. Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`.

## When to Apply

Every session, every commit. These are baseline guardrails — not optional refinements.

## Safety

- **Deletion is irreversible.** Move to an archive directory, rename with a prefix, or ask — don't destroy.
- **Protect critical files.** Configuration files, identity files, environment files — confirm before overwriting.
- **When in doubt, ask.** A question costs nothing. A bad assumption costs a rollback.

## Git Discipline

- **Commit with clean, descriptive messages.** The message should explain what changed and why, not just "update files."
- **Don't leave local-only commits.** Push when work is ready. Unpushed commits are invisible to everyone else.
- **Know which branch deploys.** Don't push to main without intent. Work on feature/dev branches.
- **Atomic commits.** One concern per commit. Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **Conventional commit format.** `type(scope): description` — type is `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`. Scope is optional but helpful.

## Closing the Loop

- **Fix the system, not just the instance.** When you find a bug, ask: what allowed this to happen? Fix the root cause — a missing test, a stale check, a gap in validation.
- **When code changes, check the tools.** Scripts, verification checks, and tests can go stale when the code they operate on changes. After any structural change, verify that tooling still produces correct results.
- **Tests match shipped code.** Write tests for what you just committed — same commit or next. Don't write tests for features that don't exist yet. Don't skip tests because "it's just a refactor."
