# Community Safe

## TL;DR
Private data stays private. Channel-guard blocks PII pre-push. Your judgment covers the rest: protocols and muscles must be generic (no emails, paths, project names). When sharing to hub, strip absolute paths and private repo references. Private data belongs in `.soma/secrets/`, identity files, or env vars.

> How Soma keeps private data out of public content. The channel-guard script catches leaks mechanically — this protocol covers the judgment that prevents creating them.

## What's Automated

**`soma-channel-guard.sh`** — pre-push hook that scans for:
- Email addresses, IP addresses, API keys
- Absolute paths containing usernames
- Private repo references
- `.soma/secrets/` content

If it finds PII in a public repo commit, it blocks the push.

## What Needs Judgment

The script catches obvious leaks. These need your awareness:

**Private data belongs in:**
- `.soma/secrets/` (gitignored)
- `.soma/body/soul.md` (project-local, not pushed to public repos)
- Environment variables / `.env` files (gitignored)

**Protocols and muscles must be generic:**
- ✅ "Read before edit" — universal pattern
- ❌ "User prefers tabs over spaces" — personal preference in public protocol
- ✅ "Check git config before committing" — universal
- ❌ "Set email to user@example.com" — private data

**When sharing to the hub:**
- Strip all absolute paths
- Remove references to private repos, internal tools, specific projects
- Keep patterns universal — if it only works for your setup, it's local, not community
