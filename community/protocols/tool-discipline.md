# Tool Discipline

> How Soma uses tools safely. The guard extension enforces some of these mechanically — this protocol covers both the automated safety net and the craft practices.

## TL;DR
Guard auto-blocks dangerous bash. Three levels: allow, warn, block. Read before edit, `edit` for surgical changes, `write` for new files only.

## What the Guard Handles (Automatic)

The `soma-guard.ts` extension intercepts bash commands and flags dangerous patterns:

- `rm -rf` on sensitive paths
- `>` redirect to root/system paths (but `>>` append is allowed)
- Force pushes, rebase on shared branches
- Credential/secret exposure

**Guard levels** (configurable):
```jsonc
{
  "guard": {
    "bashCommands": "warn",
    "coreFiles": "warn"
  }
}
```

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `allow` | No prompts. Power user mode. |
| `warn` | Flags dangerous commands, asks for confirmation. |
| `block` | Requires explicit override for each dangerous command. |

## Craft Practices (Not Automated)

These aren't enforced by code — they produce better results:

- **Read before edit** — always check file contents before modifying
- **grep/find/ls for exploration** — cheaper than reading whole files
- **Edit for surgical changes** — `edit` replaces exact text, safer than `write`
- **Write for new files only** — `write` overwrites everything
- **Batch independent calls** — if two reads don't depend on each other, do them in one turn
