# Tool Discipline

> How Soma uses tools safely and efficiently. Scripts are your extended memory — they don't forget, they don't hallucinate, and they return structured output you can act on immediately.

## TL;DR
Scripts first, raw commands second. Read before edit. Build tools for yourself — when you do the same thing twice manually, make a script. Guard auto-blocks dangerous bash. The agent that builds its own tools gets faster every session.

## Script-First Workflow

Your scripts live in `.soma/amps/scripts/`. They're surfaced at boot and tracked by usage.

**Before writing a raw command, check:**
1. Is there a script that does this? (`ls .soma/amps/scripts/`)
2. Does it have `--help`? (Run it to see what it does)
3. Can an existing script be extended instead of writing a new one?

**When to build a new script:**
- You've done the same manual command pattern 2+ times
- The task has multiple steps that should be atomic
- You want future sessions to have this capability

**Script standards:**
- Add `--help` with usage examples
- Add header comments explaining purpose
- Leave breadcrumbs in comments: "Related: <muscle-name>, <other-script>"
- Use `.soma/` discovery (walk up from cwd) so scripts work in any project

## What the Guard Handles (Automatic)

The `soma-guard.ts` extension intercepts bash commands and flags dangerous patterns:

- `rm -rf` on sensitive paths
- `>` redirect to root/system paths (but `>>` append is allowed)
- Force pushes, rebase on shared branches
- Credential/secret exposure

**Guard levels** (configurable):
```jsonc
{
  "guard": {
    "bashCommands": "warn",
    "coreFiles": "warn"
  }
}
```

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `allow` | No prompts. Power user mode. |
| `warn` | Flags dangerous commands, asks for confirmation. |
| `block` | Requires explicit override for each dangerous command. |

## Craft Practices

- **Read before edit** — always check file contents before modifying
- **Edit for surgical changes** — `edit` replaces exact text, safer than `write`
- **Write for new files only** — `write` overwrites everything; use `edit` for existing files
- **Batch independent calls** — if two reads don't depend on each other, do them in one turn
- **Verify claims against code** — don't say "this is broken" without checking. Run it. Read the output.
- **Blast radius with multiple tools** — one tool isn't enough. Before changing a function or type:
  1. `grep -rn "name" src/` — find code references
  2. `grep -rn "name" tests/` — find test coverage (if nothing, you need to add tests)
  3. `grep -rn "name" docs/` — find doc references to update
  4. Check scripts that might reference it
  A single grep misses things. Use 3-4 searches across different directories to catch the full blast radius.

## Shipped Tools

Install from the community hub to extend your toolkit:

| Task | Script | Install |
|------|--------|---------|
| Navigate codebase (find, map, refs, structure) | `soma-code` | `/hub install script soma-code` |
| Doc discovery + SDK research | `soma-scrape` | `/hub install script soma-scrape` |
| Spelling + grammar checking | `soma-spell` | `/hub install script soma-spell` |

Browse all available scripts: `/hub list --remote script`

Run any script with `--help` for full usage. Build your own — drop a `.sh` into `.soma/amps/scripts/` and it's available next session. Drop it into `.soma/amps/scripts/commands/` and it becomes a `/soma <name>` command.
