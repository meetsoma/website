<!-- tldr -->
Two levels: project (`.soma/` in repo) and user (`~/.soma/agent/`). Project has: identity.md, STATE.md, protocols/, memory/ (muscles, preloads, sessions), settings.json, scripts/. User has: global settings, extensions (soma-boot, soma-header, soma-statusline), global skills. Identity + memory are gitignored (personal). STATE.md + skills are tracked (shareable).
<!-- /tldr -->

Soma uses two levels of storage: **project-level** (`.soma/` in your repo) and **user-level** (`~/.soma/agent/`).

## Project-Level: `.soma/`

Lives in your project root. Contains everything specific to this project.

```
.soma/
├── identity.md              ← who Soma is in this project
├── STATE.md                 ← project architecture truth (ATLAS)
├── settings.json            ← configurable thresholds (optional)
├── .protocol-state.json     ← heat state for protocols (auto-managed)
├── protocols/               ← behavioral rules (heat-tracked)
│   ├── breath-cycle.md      ← hot: always loaded
│   ├── git-identity.md      ← warm: breadcrumb in prompt
│   └── _template.md         ← template for new protocols
├── memory/
│   ├── muscles/             ← learned patterns (auto-discovered)
│   │   └── deployment.md    ← example: learned deployment process
│   ├── preload-next.md      ← state for next session inhale
│   └── sessions/
│       └── 2026-03-08.md    ← daily work log
├── skills/                  ← project-specific skills (optional)
└── extensions/              ← project-specific extensions (optional)
```

### Marker Files

Soma identifies a valid `.soma/` directory by looking for at least one of:
- `STATE.md`
- `identity.md`
- `memory/` directory
- `protocols/` directory
- `settings.json`

### Git Strategy

| File | Git Status | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `STATE.md` | Tracked | Architecture truth, useful to collaborators |
| `skills/` | Tracked | Project-specific skills, shareable |
| `identity.md` | **Gitignored** | Personal — Soma's identity is unique to each user |
| `memory/` | **Gitignored** | Session-specific, personal |
| `sessions/` | **Gitignored** | Daily logs, personal |

## User-Level: `~/.soma/agent/`

Global settings and runtime. Shared across all projects.

```
~/.soma/agent/
├── settings.json            ← compaction, startup, changelog prefs
├── core/                    ← symlink → agent/core/ (runtime modules)
├── extensions/              ← globally installed extensions
│   ├── soma-boot.ts         ← identity + preload + protocols + muscles
│   ├── soma-header.ts       ← branded σῶμα header
│   └── soma-statusline.ts   ← footer with context/cost/git
├── skills/                  ← globally installed skills
└── sessions/                ← Pi session JSONL files
```

## How Memory Flows

```
Fresh session (soma):
  ~/.soma/agent/extensions/ load
  → walk up CWD for .soma/ (project → parent → global chain)
  → run boot steps (configurable in settings.json):
    1. identity — load identity.md (layered)
    2. preload — skip (fresh session)
    3. protocols — load by heat (hot=full, warm=breadcrumb, cold=name)
    4. muscles — load by heat within token budget
    5. scripts — list available .soma/scripts/
    6. git-context — inject recent commits + changed files
  → inject all into system prompt

Continue session (soma -c):
  → same as above, plus:
  → step 2 loads .soma/memory/preload-next.md as continuation context

Breathe (/breathe or auto at configurable threshold):
  → agent writes .soma/memory/preload-next.md
  → save protocol + muscle heat state (with decay for unused)
  → agent commits work
  → auto-continues into fresh session

Exhale (/exhale):
  → same save as breathe, but session ends
```

## Multiple Projects

Each project gets its own `.soma/`. When you `cd` between projects and run `soma`, she loads the identity and memory for *that* project. Different projects, different Somas.

```
~/project-a/.soma/identity.md   ← "I'm a frontend specialist"
~/project-b/.soma/identity.md   ← "I'm a systems engineer"
```

Same `soma` CLI, different memories.
