## [Unreleased]

_(empty — last stamp was v0.20.2)_

---

## [0.20.2] — 2026-04-18

The v0.20.3 prompt refactor arc. Moves Soma from "replace Pi's prompt wholesale"
(compileFullSystemPrompt rebuild path) to "let Pi compile; we augment" (SYSTEM.md
+ APPEND_SYSTEM.md via Pi's native auto-discovery). Option B from the REFACTOR-PLAN.
Also: 5 script-backed Pi tools, a pretest CLI, and two version-check bug fixes.

Pi-native mode is now DEFAULT when SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md exist. Escape
hatch: `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT=1` forces the old full-replacement path. Kept alive
until Phase 1c.2 (planned deletion of ~300 LOC rebuild path).

### Added
- **smarter randomizer + version-aware skeletons + CLI integration**
- **three-layer version snapshot + update check (SX-489)**

**Phase 1a/1b — SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md auto-discovery pipeline:**
- `compileSystemMd(options)` + `writeSystemMd(options)` in `core/prompt.ts`. Compiles
  identity-only content (soul + voice + body + ecosystem + core_rules) to
  `<somaPath>/SYSTEM.md`. Pi auto-discovers via
  `resource-loader.js:660 discoverSystemPromptFile()` and uses as `customPrompt`.
- `compileAppendSystemMd(options)` + `writeAppendSystemMd(options)` in `core/prompt.ts`.
  Compiles AMPS + tools + guard + docs to `<somaPath>/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. Pi auto-discovers
  via `resource-loader.js:671 discoverAppendSystemPromptFile()` and uses as `appendSystemPrompt`.
- Writers wired in `extensions/soma-boot.ts`: `writeSystemMd` at `session_start`,
  `writeAppendSystemMd` at `before_agent_start` (eagerly, before path split, so both
  Pi-native and legacy paths keep APPEND current).
- `SYSTEM_MD_FALLBACKS` constant: minimum-viable Soma-voice prose for empty soul/voice/body/
  core_rules. Keeps SYSTEM.md coherent in fresh-install directories.

**Phase 1c.1 — Pi-native as default:**
- `before_agent_start` now defaults to Pi-native when SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md exist.
- Legacy opt-out via `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT=1`. First-run safety: missing files → legacy path
  runs, seeds files for session N+1.

**Phase 1d — XML tag experiment (Anthropic-style adherence aid):**
- `<rules>` tag around core_rules in SYSTEM.md output (first behavioral tag in our
  compiled prompt — previously we had only Pi's native `<available_skills>`).
- `<behavioral_rules>` + `<tool_guidance>` tags in APPEND_SYSTEM.md. Matches Anthropic's
  own prompt conventions (Sonnet 4.5 → 4.6 doubled tag count; we were at 1).

**Phase 2 — 5 script-backed Pi tools (`extensions/soma-code-tools.ts`):**
- `code_find` — grep with file:line:match output, respects .gitignore (cap 500)
- `code_map` — function/class/method index for a file
- `code_refs` — symbol references classified as DEF / USE / IMP (run before renaming)
- `code_structure` — directory tree with file sizes, max depth 3
- `code_blast` — blast radius: all files touching a symbol with severity (run before deleting)
- All `executionMode: "parallel"` (read-only, safe concurrent), ANSI colors stripped,
  output capped with helpful refinement hints when truncated.
- `promptSnippet` + `promptGuidelines` populated on all 5 so Pi surfaces them in the
  "Available tools:" / "Guidelines:" prose (first effect visible post Phase 1c.1).

**`soma preview` — pretest CLI (`scripts/soma-preview.{sh,ts}`):**
- Compiles SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md from live body files without a sandbox restart.
- Flags: `--out <dir>`, `--system-only`, `--append-only`, `--quiet`, `--diff`, `--help`.
- `--diff` compares fresh compile against on-disk files with byte deltas and staleness.
- Runs outside the TUI. No API cost.
- Distinct from `scripts/prompt-preview.ts` (fixtures-based scenarios for testing).

### Fixed
- **cap items per version (highlights only, not full changelog)**
- **pi-agent keyword false-positive on public package**
- **auto-advance workspace marker when no migration is pending**

- **`soma update` false positive on dev versions.** The CLI update check used string
  comparison (`latest > VERSION`) which made `"0.3.4" > "0.20.1.1"` true (`'3' > '2'`
  lexically). Dev users on 0.20.x were told to "update" to stable 0.3.x — which is older.
  Fix: use `semverCmp()` (already defined in the module, just not called here).
  Applied to both `repos/agent/npm/thin-cli.js` and `repos/agent-2x/npm/thin-cli.js`.
- **`npm install -g meetsoma` EEXIST on dev installs.** When `soma` bin is a manual
  symlink to `repos/agent/dist/cli.js` (typical dev setup via `soma-install.sh dev`),
  npm refuses to overwrite the unowned file. Fix: `detectDevInstall()` reads the bin's
  symlink target and, when it's not an npm-managed path, guides to
  `soma-install.sh stable` first before `npm install -g meetsoma`.
- **`delegate` tool invisible in Pi's "Available tools:" prose.** Pi intentionally omits
  custom tools when `promptSnippet` is absent (per `ToolDefinition` contract at
  `types.d.ts:289`). Added `promptSnippet` + `promptGuidelines` to `soma-delegate.ts`.
  Previously unobservable because our rebuild path stripped the section entirely;
  became visible after Phase 1c.1 landed.
- **APPEND_SYSTEM.md went stale between sessions.** Was only refreshed inside the legacy
  branch — Pi-native sessions never rewrote it even when body files or heat changed.
  Moved `writeAppendSystemMd` to run BEFORE the path split so both paths keep APPEND current.

### Changed

- `before_agent_start` restructured: APPEND refresh happens eagerly, path selection
  (Pi-native vs legacy) happens after. Escape hatch env var renamed from
  `SOMA_PI_NATIVE_PROMPT` (opt-in gate, Phase 1b Commit 3) to `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT`
  (opt-out gate, Phase 1c.1) as the default flipped.
- `compileSystemMd` source comment stamp bumped: `Phase 1a` → `Phase 1d` (tag adoption).
- `compileAppendSystemMd` source comment stamp bumped: `Phase 1b` → `Phase 1d`.

### Notes

- **Sandbox verified end-to-end** (session `s01-5c01df`): Pi-native path active,
  APPEND content visible in system prompt including Behavioral Rules, Muscle Memory,
  Tools section with all 6 tools (read, bash, edit, write, code_find, code_map,
  code_refs, code_structure, code_blast, delegate), and Tool Guidelines. Model
  naturally preferred `code_find` over `bash('soma code find ...')` — typed-tool
  adherence signal positive.
- **Phase 1c.2 deliberately deferred.** Deleting ~300 LOC of `compileFullSystemPrompt`
  + `extractSections` + `buildToolSection` + `BUILTIN_TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS` + helpers is
  the next step after one real session of Pi-native-default observation. Bisectable
  single commit when it lands.
- **Tag experiment signal pending.** `_mind.md` tags affect the legacy path (still
  reachable via `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT=1`). New-path tags are in place. The real
  adherence delta measurement requires parent meetsoma session-level observation.

## [0.20.1.1] — 2026-04-18

Role expansion + curator polish. Closes the Phase-2 delegation arc: the
curator can now run apply inline (opt-in), pending gaps flow to a
human-editable scratchpad, and roles can declare where their canonical
file lives (source-of-truth) + where artifacts go (paths block).

### Added
- **Three more roles**: `planner` (writes plan files, `[read, bash, write]`), `doc_writer` (markdown-only edits, `[read, edit, write]`), `reflector` (journal entries under `memory/journal/`, `[read, write]`). 7 roles total. Researcher deferred to v0.20.2 pending search integration.
- **`source-of-truth` frontmatter field** on roles. Project-root-relative or absolute path to the canonical role file. When set, `discoverRole` re-reads from there and `apply` writes amendments there — fixes the runtime-copy vs git-source drift v0.20.1 highlighted. Missing file → stderr warning + fallback to chain-walked copy.
- **`paths:` frontmatter block** on roles. Per-role artifact paths (`invocations`, `proposals`, `proposalsApplied`, `scratchpad`) with `{role}` templating. Absent block = hardcoded defaults (zero migration). All paths live under `memory/` so writes stay cache-safe.
- **`--auto-apply` flag** on `soma-dev children curate`. When set, auto-apply-class proposals apply inline during curate (one command for the round trip). Default OFF — proposals stay in `proposals/` for human review.
- **Scratchpad** (`memory/children/<role>/scratchpad.md`). When `--auto-apply` is off, auto-apply-class findings still write proposals AND append dated sections to the scratchpad so pending gaps are visible at a glance. Append-only; human-editable.
- **`applyProposal`** exported from `core/delegate-core.ts` as a library function. CLI stub is a thin wrapper now. `curateRole` calls it directly under `--auto-apply`. Returns structured `ApplyProposalResult` with 8 reason codes.
- **`resolveRolePaths(role, somaDir, roleDef?)`** — single source of truth for per-role artifact paths. Threaded through `logInvocation`, `scanMLRQueue`, `writeProposal`, `hasProposalBeenApplied`, and `applyProposal`.

### Fixed
- **Classifier false-positive on `what_worked` entries.** An MLR observation like `what_worked: ['Task completed within budget']` matched the config-keyword regex for `budget` and produced a bogus propose-class amendment. `inferAmendmentSection` now short-circuits on `sourceField === 'what_worked'` and routes to `accumulated_knowledge` unconditionally — success reports are observations, not config changes.

### Changed
- `curateRole` signature extends with `opts?: { autoApply?: boolean }` (back-compat default false). Returns extended `CurateResult` with `applied` array and `scratchpadAppended` count.
- `buildProposal` now accepts `roleDef` to avoid redundant `discoverRole` I/O.

### Cache-safety confirmed
`core/body.ts:628-648` iterates `readdirSync(bodyDir)` filtering `.endsWith(".md")` — directories (incl. `body/children/`) are skipped. Role edits don't invalidate parent cache. All new artifacts (scratchpad, proposals, invocations) live under `memory/` which is likewise not walked. Verified empirically: source-of-truth writes to canonical `body/children/verifier.md` completed without cache storm.

---

## [0.20.0.1] — 2026-04-18

Delegation hardening. v0.20.0 shipped the MVP; v0.20.0.1 makes it production-shaped:
model fallback chain (free-tier friendly), per-invocation health cache + cooldown,
MLR parsed into structured objects, cost/token tracking, and CLI paths (`children run`,
`children health`) for driving delegations outside the TUI.

### Added
- **Structured model chain in role frontmatter** (`model-chain:` list of entries with `id`, `class`, `cooldown-on-rate-limit`). Scalar `default-model: <id>` still works (1-entry chain back-compat).
- **Model policies** (`model-policy:` — `order` | `free-only` | `paid-only` | `prefer-free`). Runtime walks the chain per-policy, skipping unavailable or cooldown'd models.
- **Health cache + cooldown** at `.soma/state/model-health.json`. Rate-limited or dead models get marked and skipped for a TTL (default 1h). Survives across sessions.
- **MLR (Memory-Lane-Reflection) yaml parsing** on child final messages. Observations flow to `inv.mlr.{what_worked, what_struggled, missing_capability, suggested_amendments, map_issues}` in `memory/children/<role>/invocations.jsonl`. Foundation for v0.20.1's curator loop.
- **Cost + token tracking** per attempt (`inv.cost_usd`, `inv.tokens_input`, `inv.tokens_output`). Attempts array records each model tried in the chain.
- **`soma-dev children run <role> "<task>"`** — CLI stub that invokes `runDelegation` outside the TUI. Useful for dev regression + batch testing.
- **`soma-dev children health <role>`** — shows chain with per-model class, resolvable state, cooldown, filtered (per policy). Diagnostic for "why is my child using sonnet when I declared a chain?"

### Changed
- **`extensions/soma-delegate.ts` refactored to thin wrapper** (~50 lines) over `core/delegate-core.ts` (~800 lines at v0.20.0.1). Logic lives in core; extension just registers the Pi tool. Enables CLI stubs to call `runDelegation` without Pi's extension harness.
- `loadAgentClass` is now async (dual-strategy: `createRequire` for CJS, dynamic `import()` for ESM). Callers must `await`.

### Fixed
- **Free-tier rate limits (429/503) on `openrouter/*:free` models**. v0.20.0's hardcoded Haiku default was a workaround; v0.20.0.1's chain-walking is the real fix. Role can declare a free-first chain and fall through to paid-cheap on rate limit.

### Sandbox-verified (5 cases)
T1 scalar back-compat, T3 chain gemma→qwen→haiku fall-through, T4 cooldown skip, T6 MLR parsed into structured object, T7 cost $0.0044 / 2819+313 tokens.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-04-18

**Delegation MVP. Team Soma begins.** The `delegate` Pi tool spawns an in-process child agent via `pi-agent-core.Agent`, running a role-tuned system prompt while inheriting parent soul/voice/ecosystem. Foundation for everything in v0.20.x.

### Added
- **`delegate` tool** (registered via `extensions/soma-delegate.ts`). Called as `delegate(task, role?, model?)`. Spawns `pi-agent-core.Agent` in-process, tool budget enforced (`max-tool-calls`), returns summary + cost + MLR.
- **Role files** in `body/children/`: `_child.md` (sub-compiler template), `_child-template.md` (scaffold for new roles), `general.md` (starter role: Sonnet, full tools, budget 25/$0.25).
- **Role discovery via body chain.** `discoverRole` walks `body/children/<role>.md` across the soma chain (project → parent → global) so a workspace can ship roles its child projects inherit.
- **Prompt compilation** for children. Compact soul (1500 chars) + voice (1000) + ecosystem (2000) + role identity + role accumulated knowledge + task. Haiku by default so cost stays tight.
- **`soma-dev children` CLI** (new subcommand group). `list` / `show` / `add` / `edit` / `stats` / `tail` / `validate` for inspecting + managing roles and their invocation logs.
- **Invocation log** at `memory/children/<role>/invocations.jsonl`. Append-only JSONL per role: timestamp, model, tool calls, duration, cost, summary.
- **`pi-agent-core`** added as direct dependency (was transitive). Uses its `Agent` class as the child-spawning primitive.
- **Sandbox architecture** — persistent `~/soma-2x-sandbox/` folder (her filesystem) + dedicated `~/.soma-2x/agent/` install (runtime symlinks to `repos/agent-2x/`, auth/settings shared from main install). Keeps parent session's `~/.soma/agent/` untouched during iteration.
- **`soma-2x-cmux.sh`** launcher. Opens a cmux workspace with Sonnet parent + invocation-monitor pane. `--focus` / `--close` / `--restart` flags for iteration cycle.

### Fixed (during MVP verification, same release cycle)
- **`pi-agent-core.Agent` via `createRequire` bypass.** Pi's extension loader aliases `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core` and can resolve to wrong package under jiti. Switched to `createRequire(import.meta.url)` for that one import — native Node resolution bypasses jiti. `pi-ai` + `pi-coding-agent` stay ESM-only (static imports at module top).
- **Inline flow YAML arrays.** `inherits: []` was parsed as the string `"[]"`; parser now detects and splits `[a, b, c]` inline.
- **Inline YAML comments.** `default-model: claude-sonnet-4-5  # comment` previously included the comment in the value. `stripComment` handles this now (respects `#` inside quoted strings).
- **`getModel` returning `undefined`** (not throwing) when a model id was unknown. Now surfaces as a typed error the chain walker can react to.
- **OpenRouter Claude models** — wired provider + normalized id forms; `openrouter/google/gemma-4-31b-it:free` resolves correctly now.

### Notes
- Not tagged as a discrete release; delegation MVP was sandbox-internal on `dev-2x` and consolidated under the v0.20.1 tag when the curator loop landed. This entry backfills the history.

---

## [0.20.1] — 2026-04-18

Curator loop + specialized child roles (verifier, builder, curator). Closes the self-improvement cycle: delegation observations (MLR) → classifier → proposal files → human-apply → role.md amended.

> Shipped on `dev-2x` branch. Merged to `dev` at tag time. Follows v0.20.0 (delegation MVP) + v0.20.0.1 (delegation hardening).

### Added
- **Three role files** in `body/children/`: `verifier.md` (read-only, `read + bash`, PASS/FAIL + evidence), `builder.md` (write-capable, `read + bash + edit + write`, bounded edits with verify-after), `curator.md` (meta-role, `read + write`, proposes amendments). All bound to `claude-haiku-4-5` by default with per-role budgets.
- **MLR queue reader** `scanMLRQueue(role, somaDir, sinceTs?)` in `core/delegate-core.ts`. Scans `memory/children/<role>/invocations.jsonl`, flattens `mlr.{what_worked, what_struggled, missing_capability, suggested_amendments}` into structured amendment candidates.
- **Amendment classifier** `classifyAmendment(entry, evidence)` returns `auto-apply` | `propose` | `human-only` | `skip`. Auto-apply requires `accumulated_knowledge` section + ≥2 distinct invocations + text < 200 chars. `default-tools`/`budget`/`success_criteria` → `propose`. Identity/soul/voice/inherits → `human-only`.
- **Proposal writer** `writeProposal` emits `memory/children/<role>/proposals/<id>.md` with frontmatter (id, role, class, section, evidence) + body (amendment, reason, apply command).
- **`soma-dev children mlr [<role>]`** — scan MLR queue, table output (ts, source, section, text).
- **`soma-dev children curate [<role>]`** — classify queue → write proposals. Summary by class (auto-apply / propose / human-only).
- **`soma-dev children apply <proposal-id> [--force]`** — append amendment to role.md section, archive to `proposals/_applied/`. Auto-apply default; `--force` for propose-class (v0.20.1 still gates non-`accumulated_knowledge` sections).
- **Chain-walk in `children.sh`** (SX-482). Port of `core/discovery.ts:getSomaChain` to bash. Shell subcommands now resolve roles across the full soma chain (project → parent → global `~/.soma`), matching runtime behavior. Adds per-role `source` column in `list` (project/parent/global) and `--soma=<path>` pin flag.
- **Dedup in curator flow** (SX-481 fixup). `hasAmendmentInRole` + `hasProposalBeenApplied` helpers prevent duplicate bullets when curator runs on different days (slug-based dedup includes date, so same text on new day previously slipped through). Applied at both `buildProposal` (skip before write) and `apply-proposal` (skip + archive-only, defense in depth).
- **`resolveTools` honors `bash` in read-only roles** (s01-b420d5 fix). `createReadOnlyTools()` upstream returns `[Read, Grep, Find, Ls]` with no Bash; `resolveTools` was dropping the `bash` declaration for any role without edit/write. Now rebuilt declaratively from 7 individual constructors so `[read, bash]` resolves correctly.

### Changed
- `buildProposal` signature: optional `cwd` + `somaDirPath` params so library callers can thread the caller's chain into role discovery (instead of relying on `process.cwd()`).
- `curateRole` signature: optional `cwd` param threaded to `buildProposal`.
- `children list` output includes a `SOURCE` column (project/parent/global).

### Deferred to v0.20.1.1 / v0.20.2
- Remaining 4 roles: planner, doc_writer, researcher, reflector.
- Path-gated `edit` tool for curator (direct role.md edits without proposal round-trip).
- Direct auto-apply during curator run (today: curator writes proposals, human runs `apply`).
- `source-of-truth` frontmatter field — route amendments to git-canonical path, not chain-walk result (SX-483, v0.20.2).
- `soma-dev children audit` — diff runtime copies vs git source, merge in either direction (SX-484, v0.20.2).

---

## [0.12.4] — 2026-04-18

Follow-up to v0.12.3 shipping integrity. Pi runtime bump, thin-CLI UX cleanup, release-flow parity (dev ↔ main auto-sync), and a script pipefail fix.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime 0.67.6 → 0.67.68** — 2 upstream releases. Network connection retry (#3317), stable date format in system prompts (#2814), scoped-models Alt+Up/Down fix (#3331), `afterToolCall` error forwarding (#3051, #3084), git update notification reliability (#3027). New: Bedrock bearer-token auth, prompt template `argument-hint` frontmatter, `after_provider_response` extension hook, OSC 8 hyperlink rendering.
- **Release script auto-syncs `agent-stable`/main.** `soma-release.sh` now squash-merges `dev → agent-stable/main` after building soma-beta and tags both branches. Prevents the drift where agent-stable fell a full release behind dev (the v0.12.2 → v0.12.3 gap that this release closes).

### Fixed
- **Thin-CLI `update` / `check-updates` / `status` now guard on `isInstalled()`.** Previously these commands assumed `~/.soma/agent/` existed and crashed unhelpfully on a fresh global install before `soma init`. Now they show a clear "not installed — run `soma init`" message.
- **Thin-CLI header text** — `Status` → `Update` on the update subcommand (matches what the command actually does).
- **Thin-CLI help text** — `postInstallCmds` expanded from 8 to 16 commands, covers `update`, `check-updates`, `status`, `doctor`, `health`, `focus`, `model`, `exhale`, etc.
- **Pre-versioning project guidance** — correct instructions for projects that pre-date `soma init` (no version file, but `.soma/` exists).
- **Stale `soma init` → `soma update` references** in `thin-cli.js`, `docs/updating.md`, and `docs/troubleshooting.md`. Missed during the v0.12.3 command reshuffle.
- **`check-phases.sh` pipefail crash on clean working tree.** `grep -v` returns 1 on empty input, which under `set -o pipefail` killed the script mid-run. Same bug class as `soma-plans.sh` bash 3.2 issues. Script now runs all 10 phases to completion.

### Internal
- Dropped the B2 patch attempt (`settings-manager.js` enabledModels sync). Pi #3331 fixes the upstream symptom, and the target function is minified to `.n()` in 0.67.68 — patching by name would silently fail. See `.soma/releases/v0.12.x/model-resolution-audit.md`.
- `UPSTREAM-NOTES.md` scratchpad added to `soma-dev/` for tracking changelog-worthy upstream items between Pi bumps.

---

## [0.12.3] — 2026-04-17

Shipping integrity release. Fixes a critical bug where `npm install -g meetsoma@0.3.3` produced a broken install (missing internal imports), and makes the update flow actually work. If you've been stuck on an older Pi runtime despite cutting newer Soma versions, this is why.

### Fixed
- **`meetsoma@0.3.3` broken npm install**. The published tarball imported from `./lib/` and `./welcome/` paths that weren't included, so every fresh `npm install -g meetsoma` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on first run. Fixed by bundling `thin-cli.js` with esbuild into a single self-contained file before publish. Has been broken since the `npm/` reorg — unnoticed because existing users had working installs from before.
- **TUI leakage from extensions**. `soma-route.ts` had `console.error` calls that leaked into the input buffer on shutdown and during security rejects. `hub-connect.ts` (somaverse) had WebSocket handshake logs that appeared mid-keystroke in the prompt. Both silenced — matches `bridge-connect.ts`'s silent pattern.
- **Silent Pi staleness in dev**. `soma-dev status` now compares `dist/` vs `node_modules/` Pi versions and flags drift (was the root cause of the "opus-4-7 missing" bug several users hit).

### Changed
- **`soma init` no longer updates the runtime.** Previously, typing `soma init` in an already-initialized project silently ran a runtime update instead of doing project work — the confusing overload is removed. `soma init` now always means "set up this project."
- **`soma update` now actually updates.** Was previously status-only (told you to run `soma init`). Now it performs the update: `git pull --ff-only` in `~/.soma/agent/` + `npm install --omit=dev` if dependencies changed.
- **Pi runtime is now locked to Soma version.** `soma-beta/package.json` pins Pi exact (was `^0.67.6`, now `0.67.6`). `soma-beta` now ships a `package-lock.json` too — users get the exact Pi dependency tree we tested against. Pi updates only when Soma cuts a new release.
- **`soma doctor` / `soma status`** now shows installed Pi runtime version and flags drift between declared and installed. Catches the class of bug where `npm install` hadn't been re-run after a Pi bump.
- **`soma check-updates`** preserves the old "report-only" behavior that `soma update` used to have, for when you just want to see what's available without updating.

### Added
- **Periodic update check inside the agent.** `soma-statusline.ts` runs a silent `git fetch` every 30 minutes while the agent is running. If behind, shows `⬆ update` in the statusline and writes to `~/.soma/config.json` so the next `soma` boot prints a one-line notice. Zero network latency at CLI launch.
- **Pre-publish smoke test.** `soma-npm-publish.sh` now packs the tarball, extracts it to a clean temp dir, and runs `node dist/thin-cli.js --version` before allowing npm publish. Aborts if the tarball has broken imports or contains forbidden content (`dist/core/`, `.ts`, `node_modules/`, etc.). Also integrated into `soma-dev pipeline` so dev cycles catch breakage early.
- **Docker e2e sandbox** (`soma-sandbox-docker.sh local`) now reliably tests our local bundle. Previous Dockerfile had a broken `COPY ... local-pkg*` glob that created a file literally named `local-pkg*`, so the sandbox was silently falling through to the registry version. Fixed — 24/24 tests pass in clean `node:22-slim` container.

### Internal
- `repos/agent/scripts/_dev/patches/` unchanged — only `error-sanitizer` remains. An attempt to add a `settings-manager-enabled-models` patch was rolled back when it turned out not to be necessary (speculation from an inbox report; the actual user bug was update-flow staleness, not Ctrl+P cycling).
- New muscles: `inbox-handling.md` (inbox letters are diagnoses, not FYIs), `tui-safe-logging.md` (no bare `console.*` in extensions).
- New soma-dev-map phase entry: Phase 0 orient now checks Pi drift (`soma-dev status`) and scans inbox as part of orientation.

---

## [0.12.2] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`soma model` command** — Switch your default model from the CLI. Fuzzy matching (`soma model opus`), interactive selection when multiple matches, persistent save to settings. Subcommands: `soma model <pattern> set` (save without starting), `soma model <pattern> start` (save + start session), `soma model --list [search]` (browse models).
- **Claude Opus 4.7 support** — Available via `/model` in-session or `soma model opus-4-7 set` from CLI. Includes adaptive thinking support.
- **`soma-dev check-upstream`** — Detect and audit Pi runtime updates. Checks changelog, extension surface, provider diffs, patch compatibility. Supports `--audit` (full analysis) and `--json` (machine-readable).
- **`soma-dev check-docs`** — Stale reference sweep across docs and website. Catches old version numbers, deprecated APIs, provider count mismatches.
- **`soma-dev check-phases`** — Verify dev cycle phase completion before release. Checks artifacts across all 10 phases. Supports `--patch` for reduced requirements.
- **`--no-context-files` / `-nc` flag** — Skip AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md loading for clean sessions without project context injection.
- **`after_provider_response` extension hook** — Extensions can inspect provider HTTP status and headers after each response.

### Changed
- **CLI help reorganized** — Session flags (`--model`, `--provider`, `--thinking`) now grouped under "Session Options (apply to this session only)" to distinguish from persistent project commands (`soma model`, `soma focus`).
- **Prompt caching improved** — Tool schemas now cached independently from the system prompt. Adding/removing tools no longer invalidates your entire system prompt cache (reduces cost when workspace tools connect/disconnect).
- **Fresh boot greeting** — When a preload exists but wasn't loaded (plain `soma` vs `soma inhale`), the greeting now says so explicitly and suggests `/inhale`. Prevents the agent from reading stale preloads on clean starts.

### Fixed
- **`grep` tool performance** — No longer stalls on broad searches with `context=0`.
- **`find` tool gitignore** — Nested `.gitignore` rules no longer leak across sibling directories.
- **Type safety** — Fixed `breathe.preloadStaleThreshold` type cast for Pi 0.67.6 compatibility.
- **Preload validator** — Section header matching is now fuzzy — accepts `## Next Session`, `## Next Session: Priorities`, `## Next Session: [Task Name]`, etc.
- **Protocol warm fallback** — Protocols with `description` in frontmatter now use it for warm-tier display when `breadcrumb` is absent. Most protocols already use `description` — this fix makes them visible at warm tier.
- **Template sync** — Shipped improved `_memory.md` template to all users (Traps section, phase breadcrumbs, warning-task binding guidance).
- **4 missing providers** — Kimi Coding, Minimax, Z.ai, and Vercel AI Gateway added to docs. Provider count updated from 17 to 23.

### Upgraded
- Pi runtime 0.67.1 → 0.67.6 (5 releases, 15+ fixes)

---

## [0.12.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Image budget auto-compact loop** — `checkImageBudget()` runs on a 5-second timer but `ctx.compact()` is async. The image counter wasn't reset until `onComplete`, so the next timer tick re-fired the warning and compact attempt, looping 6+ times. Added `imageCompactInFlight` guard flag.

---

## [0.12.0] — 2026-04-15 — Somaverse Edition

Soma meets the Somaverse. Your agent can now connect to somaverse.ai,
control your workspace remotely, and pair with your browser — all through
a secure relay. Data stays on your machine. The shard is just the pipe.

### Added
- **`soma login`** — Pair your agent with Somaverse. Creates a pairing code, opens your browser, and saves your device key. One command to connect.
- **Hub-connect extension** — Connects your agent to the Somaverse hub as a provider. Your browser pairs with it automatically. Works alongside bridge-connect (local + cloud simultaneously).
- **Workspace proxy** — All 28 workspace + browser tools work through the hub relay. Your agent controls the workspace even from a remote machine.
- **Device-key auth** — Workspace tools auto-detect hub mode when `~/.soma/device-key` exists. Routes to hub URL with Bearer auth instead of localhost.
- **28 agent tools** — 10 workspace, 10 browser, 5 AI, 2 plugin state, 1 browser_links (new).

### Architecture
- **Reverse proxy model** — The Somaverse hub relays WebSocket messages between your browser and your agent. It never stores your data — everything flows through to your machine.
- **Per-user isolation** — Device keys are Argon2-hashed. Each user’s workspace connection is paired by user_id. No cross-user access possible.
- **Modular extensions** — bridge-connect (local), hub-connect (cloud). Both run simultaneously with dedup. Add a service, add an extension.

### Security
- Device keys: 192-bit random, Argon2 hashed in DB
- Transport: WSS via Traefik + Let’s Encrypt
- Hub proxy: Bearer device_key + JWT cookie auth on every request
- CORS: restricted to somaverse.ai, somaverse.space, dev.somaverse.ai

### Fixed
- **Breathe stale warning** — disabled by default. Was firing every turn in long sessions ("28 tool calls since preload"). Now fires at most once, configurable via `breathe.preloadStaleThreshold` in settings.

---

## [0.11.4] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Script root-finding** — `_find_root()` in 10 dev scripts now checks `repos/agent/package.json` to distinguish `meetsoma/` from `repos/agent/` (both had `.soma/` and `repos/` dirs).
- **sync-docs.sh** — prefers `agent/` (dev) over `agent-stable/` (main) for Phase 5 doc sync.

### Added
- **Image budget** — auto-compact when screenshots accumulate. Soft notify at 8 images, hard auto-compact at 10. Counts all image sources (browser_screenshot, Read tool, user-pasted). Counter resets on compact. Visible in `/status`.
- **`imageBudget` settings** — `softAt` and `hardAt` configurable via `settings.json`. Set `hardAt: 0` to disable.
- **`breathe.maxTokens` setting** — caps the effective context window for breathe threshold calculations. Fixes breathe being dormant on 1M-context models where 50% = 500K tokens.
- **Sandbox source flags** — `soma-sandbox.sh --dev` builds and tests from dev branch. `--main` tests agent-stable. `--beta` (default) tests soma-beta. API tests default to claude-haiku-4-5.
- **14 new settings tests** — covers removed fields, new fields, multi-level inheritance, array replacement.

### Changed
- **Settings cleanup** — removed 3 never-implemented settings: `memory.flowUp`, `sessions.overwriteGuard`, `checkpoints.project.workingBranch`. Default version updated 0.6.4 → 0.11.3.

## [0.11.3] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Script description parser** — `getScriptMeta()` was parsing YAML frontmatter delimiters (`---`) as the script description. Every frontmatter-using script showed "---" in the system prompt. Parser now skips frontmatter blocks, extracts `# description:` fields, skips decorative lines, and scans 30 lines instead of 15.

### Changed
- **Docs version sweep** — 6 docs updated: stale version refs (v0.9.0→v0.11.2, v0.2.0→v0.3.3), extension table 4→8, scripts.md restructured into Bundled/Advanced/Hub sections.

## [0.11.2] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **soma-install.sh paths** — updated `products/soma` → `meetsoma/repos` references.
- **Duplicate session files in rotation boot** — rotation path embedded file hints in both greeting AND session_files template variable. Now greeting is narrative only, session_files handled by template (matching normal boot pattern from 4d8331f).
- **Triple error cascade on API failure** — three independent handlers fired on single error. Added errorHandled flag, else-if chain, gated fatal-session check.
- **False-positive billing detection removed** — `err.includes("extra usage")` matched Claude consumer error text, not actual billing issues. Pi shows raw API errors natively. Removed our pattern matching entirely.
- **Doctor fallback version** — hardcoded 0.10.0 → 0.11.1.
- **Build pipeline** — `build-dist.mjs` was reading Pi 0.64.0 from stale `repos/cli/dist`. Now reads from npm (Pi 0.67.1). Root cause of months of invisible dist/ drift.
- **Release script** — removed stale `CLI_DIST` reference; Soma brand themes were being overwritten by Pi defaults.
- **Dev-mode theme crash** — Pi's config.js resolves to `src/` when it exists. Added symlinks for theme, export-html, and assets paths.
- **Stale docs** — `repos/cli` ref in install-architecture.md.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime 0.64.0 → 0.67.1** — dist/ was stuck at Pi 0.64.0 despite package.json claiming ^0.66.1. Synced from npm. Gets stack overflow fix for long sessions (#2651), subscription auth warning, queued message flush fix.
- **Pi telemetry disabled** — set PI_TELEMETRY=0 in cli.js to prevent install ping added in Pi 0.67.1.
- **Rotation boot aligned with decomposition** — greeting no longer embeds session file hints. Consistent with normal boot path pattern.
- **Error handling** — auth-aware (OAuth vs API key). Account rate limits (real plan limit) handled separately from extra-usage classification errors (often transient). OAuth: progressive retry → warn → pause at 4th. API key: pause immediately.
- **Error display** — build-time error-sanitizer patch converts raw JSON API errors to human-readable messages. Billing errors show progressive messages. Retryable errors (overloaded, 500) pass through untouched.

### Added
- **`soma-dev verify upstream`** — detects dist/ vs node_modules/ drift by fingerprinting key runtime files. Prevents the 0.64→0.66 invisible drift.
- **Runtime integrity tests** — test-hygiene.sh now checks telemetry disable, boot decomposition, billing removal, error cascade flag, verify-upstream existence.
- **Release pipeline gate** — `soma-release.sh` now blocks on dist/ upstream drift detection before building.
- **Error-sanitizer** — build-time patch to Pi's display layer. Progressive billing messages, auth/model rewrites. Zero cache impact.
- **Patch manifest** — `scripts/_dev/patches/manifest.json` tracks applied dist/ patches.
- **CLI repo archived** — content merged to agent README. `meetsoma/cli` archived on GitHub.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Cache invalidation from image stripping** — removed progressive image stripping from `before_provider_request` in soma-guard. Each new screenshot changed the strip set, invalidating the entire cache ($2-3 per invalidation, $152/day on Apr 12). Image management now handled by capture-time optimization + future auto-compact.
- **Zombie sessions** — idle shutdown timer now runs independently of keepalive. Post-exhale shutdown (15 min) + absolute timeout (30 min). Previously, disabling keepalive also disabled the shutdown check.
- **Boot resume cache waste** — silent resume when no .soma files changed. Was injecting "Nothing changed" message that cost ~$1.78 in cache rewrite with zero value.
- **Keepalive on fatal errors** — kill keepalive on first-turn API failures to prevent infinite retry loops.
- **Billing notice handling** — separate billing notices from error-pause logic so keepalive isn't killed on credit warnings.
- **Pipeline** — remove `streamingBehavior` (not in Pi types), fix `focus --help` without seam.

### Added
- **Cache health tracking** — statusline tracks cacheRead, cacheWrite, cost per session. Alerts on cache invalidations (>50K token writes). Footer shows ✓cache / Ninv indicator.
- **Idle session detection** — auto-shutdown after configurable idle period with no user input.

### Changed
- Cache health indicator moved to statusline line 2 (line 1 was crowded).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-12

Identity overhaul + first-run experience. soul.md replaces SOMA.md as default. Minimal boot for new projects. 11 bundled scripts. Critical doctor fix.

### Added
- **`soma session`** — session maintenance tool. `strip-images` removes base64 image data from JSONL (16MB → 2.6MB), `list` shows all sessions with sizes, `stats` analyzes image payload.
- **test-install-flows.sh** — 36-assertion E2E test suite covering fresh init, v0.6→current upgrade, edge cases (corrupt settings, missing version, empty body/).
- **Discovery marker: `body`** — `findSomaDir()` now detects projects with only `body/soul.md` (no SOMA.md).
- **User extension preservation** — reinstall preserves user-installed extensions (bridge-connect.ts, workspace-tools.ts) alongside auth.json and models.json.
- **Extension allowlist** — configure approved extensions in settings.json, `/soma doctor` reports unlisted extensions.
- **Image payload guard** — `before_provider_request` strips old images when >15 accumulate in conversation. Prevents Anthropic many-image 2000px limit.

### Changed
- **Identity: soul.md is primary** — `initSoma` creates `body/soul.md` instead of `SOMA.md`. `ensureGlobalSoma` creates `body/soul.md` at `~/.soma/`. SOMA.md and identity.md still work as fallbacks. All docs, templates, tree diagrams updated (30+ files).
- **autoInject default: false** — new projects use `soma inhale` for intentional preload loading. Existing settings preserved on upgrade.
- **First-run minimal boot** — first session skips hot protocol/muscle injection into system prompt. Agent discovers through use.
- **Pi 0.65 migration** — `session_switch`/`session_fork` → `session_start` with `event.reason`.
- **Protocol heat-defaults reclassified** — only `breath-cycle` and `working-style` start warm. All others cold.
- **11 bundled scripts** (was 6) — added soma-body, soma-refactor, soma-reflect, soma-plans, soma-session.
- **Template single source** — `body/_public/` deleted, templates read from `templates/default/`.
- **Hub template install** — fetches soul.md → SOMA.md → identity.md, writes to body/soul.md for new projects.

### Fixed
- **Critical: semver comparison in thin-cli.js** — doctor used JS string comparison (`"0.6.2" > "0.10.0"`), so upgrades NEVER ran for any project. Added `semverCmp()` for proper numeric comparison.
- **CLI UX** — `soma help`, `soma version` now work (bare words). `soma init` when .soma/ exists routes to doctor instead of broken TUI.
- **Image payload guard** — strips old images from conversation history, pauses keepalive on 400/invalid_request errors (was only 429). Prevents infinite retry deadlock.
- **Parent chain detection** — init.ts walker now checks `body/soul.md` and `settings.json`, not just `SOMA.md`/`identity.md`.
- **soma verify crash** — `${*}` with `set -u` caused unbound variable when called without args.
- **Stale refs sweep** — 30+ files across docs, core, templates, scripts, community. `identity.md` → `body/soul.md` in all user-facing strings.
- **Script path leaks** — soma-health, soma-verify, soma-seam, soma-refactor guarded behind path existence checks.
- **Sandbox** — was creating `identity.md` (deprecated), now creates `body/soul.md`.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-10

Restructure release. AMPS consolidated, CLI script routing, Pi runtime bumped, 25 commits since v0.9.0.

### Added
- **v0.8.1→v0.9.0 migration map** — settings additions (inherit, keepalive, heat.autoDetectBump), script routing syntax, AMPS consolidation notes. Chains with existing migration maps.
- **soma-health.sh** — project health dashboard script.
- **Docker sandbox** — `soma-sandbox.sh` can now use Docker for isolated E2E testing (21/21 tests pass).
- **test-hygiene.sh** — repo cleanliness checks (secrets, sessions, dev artifacts).
- **verify-amps command** — CWD path resolution, community protocol source validation.
- **3 scripts promoted to bundled** — soma-verify.sh, soma-refactor.sh, soma-browser.sh moved from dev to discoverable.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime 0.64.0 → 0.66.1** — 2 minor versions, bug fixes, no breaking changes.
- **Docs: CLI syntax** — all 8 doc files updated from `soma-code.sh` to `soma code` syntax. Website synced.
- **Scripts reorganized** — 39 dev scripts moved to `_dev/`, 3 promoted to bundled, redundant scripts archived.
- **CWD safety audit** — dev-path guards on Tier 2 scripts, soma-query demoted to `_dev/`.

### Fixed
- **soma-guard: orphaned tool_result sanitizer** — `before_provider_request` handler removes orphaned tool_result blocks before API call. Prevents 400 errors from upstream Pi bug.
- **soma-statusline: auto-pause keepalive on rate limit** — detects 429/rate_limit errors, auto-disables keepalive. Prevented 67+ wasted requests per rate-limit window.
- **soma-doctor.sh: follow core/ symlink** — was reading stale `~/.soma/agent/package.json` (v0.6.0) instead of following symlink to dev repo. Now resolves through readlink.
- **init.ts: read version from package.json** — was hardcoded to 0.6.2, now reads dynamically.
- **Sandbox: deterministic prompt template test** — replaced LLM-dependent test with file-read verification.
- **Sandbox: extension/protocol count comparison** — use `>=` instead of `==` for forward compatibility.
- **soma-boot: streamingBehavior on all sendUserMessage calls** — 10 calls patched, prevents runtime errors.
- **Keepalive infinite loop** — `keepaliveInFlight` flag prevents auto-exhale from re-triggering keepalive.
- **CI: npm ci + tsx PATH** — added to all test suites for clean CI runs.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **`{{inbox_summary}}` template variable** — scans `.soma/inbox/` at boot, injects unread message summary into system prompt. File-based async messaging between agents.
- **`{{scripts_table}}` in default `_mind.md`** — agents can now see their discovered scripts in the system prompt.
- **`preload.autoInject` setting** — auto-inject most recent preload on fresh boot (default: true). No longer requires `soma inhale` CLI command for preload loading.
- **7 new documentation pages** — `inbox.md`, `doctor.md`, `hub.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `guides/daily-workflow.md`, `guides/customization.md`, `guides/first-protocol.md`. Total: 33 pages (~36K words).
- **`inter-agent-inbox` community protocol** — published to community hub. Formal spec for file-based inter-agent messaging.
- **Script drift detection** — `soma-verify.sh drift` now checks scripts across agent repo → working copies → global.

### Changed
- **Digest → TL;DR migration complete** — 96 files converted from `<!-- digest:start/end -->` to `## TL;DR`. Both formats still accepted, `## TL;DR` is the standard going forward.
- **Docs accuracy overhaul** — 13 existing pages updated: `autoInject` mental model, version refs, `breadcrumb` → `description`, `maxTokens` default, session log naming format, identity.md deprecated.

### Fixed
- **Keepalive limit not enforcing** — keepalive-triggered turns reset the ping counter, making keepalives infinite. Now tracks `keepaliveInFlight` flag to skip reset on self-initiated turns.
- **Changelog hook targets [0.12.2] — 2026-04-17 only** — old hook appended to first `### Added`/`### Fixed` globally, which could hit released versions.
- **Test suite** — added `tsx` to devDependencies (bare `tsx` calls failed), fixed 10 stale test paths (`body/public` → `body/_public`, `identity.md` → `SOMA.md`).
- **Stale `body/public` references** — updated to `body/_public` across comments, docs, templates, and scripts (6 files).

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Unified warm content format** — `## TL;DR` replaces `<!-- digest:start/end -->` across all AMPS. Protocols, muscles, and automations all use the same format. Code accepts both during transition.
- **`extractTldr()`** — shared utility for extracting TL;DR sections, used by protocols, muscles, and automations.
- **MAP = automation alias** — `map` accepted as type alias in `/hub install`, `/hub fork`, `/hub share`. MAPs are a type of automation.
- **Discovery unification** — `discoverMaps()` now scans `amps/automations/` root alongside `maps/` subdirectories. Installed hub automations are visible as MAPs.
- **Keepalive limits** — 5 pings per idle period (configurable 0–5), countdown in notification (`♥ Keepalive 3/5`), resets on user message.
- **Auto-exhale on idle** — when keepalive lives are exhausted and context exceeds 75k tokens, the agent automatically writes a preload. Configurable via `keepalive.autoExhale` and `keepalive.autoExhaleMinTokens`.
- **Migration phase `v0.8.0→v0.8.1`** — Tier 1 auto-converts muscle digest blocks to TL;DR format, adds keepalive settings.

### Changed
- **`soma-doctor.sh`** — reads agent version from `package.json` instead of hardcoded string.
- **Hub validator** — accepts `description`/`triggers`/`tags`, prefers `## TL;DR` over `<!-- digest -->`, warns on legacy format.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`soma doctor`** — project health check and migration from CLI. Tier 1 auto-fixes (settings, body, protocols) run silently on every boot. TUI `/soma doctor` provides interactive Tier 2+ migration with `compareTemplates()` analysis.
- **`soma status` / `soma health`** — quick project health check (renamed from old `soma doctor`).
- **`soma --version`** — shows both agent and CLI versions.
- **`soma --help`** — delegates to core agent for full branded help output.
- **Migration phase system** — `cycle.md` + 9 phase files covering v0.6.1 → v0.8.0. Each phase is self-contained with from/to versions, actions, and what changed. Complete chain with no gaps.
- **`_doctor-update.md` + `_doctor-pending.md`** — boot templates for agent-assisted migration. Pending template injected into followUp when updates available.
- **`compareTemplates()`** — three-category file diff (content files, metadata, runtime) for doctor analysis.
- **`findChildSomaDirs()`** — walks filesystem to discover child `.soma/` directories for multi-project support.
- **`doctor.autoUpdate` + `declinedVersion`** — per-project settings controlling update notification behavior.
- **Warm AMPS** — skill loader shows full TL;DR or digest for warm content, short description for cold. All AMPS types unified.
- **Body templates** — improved starters for soul.md, voice.md, journal.md, pulse.md, body.md. DNA.md rewrite with self-awareness, owner’s manual, and deep reference links.
- **`_first-breath.md`** — context-aware first-run template with conditional blocks for monorepos, blank projects, code projects, global/inherited `.soma/`.
- **Test suites** — `test-doctor.sh` (46 tests), `test-migrations.sh` (48 tests) covering all doctor features and migration chain integrity.
- **Docs** — `updating.md` (migration guide), `install-architecture.md` (CLI → agent flow), `body.md` (full body architecture reference with variables, templates, chain, lifecycle).

### Changed
- **CLI routing overhaul** — `doctor`, `status`, `health`, `update`, `version` all route through thin-cli. `--help` delegates to core when agent is installed.
- **Starter content** — code fallbacks synced to `_public/` templates, HTML comments stripped from shipped content.
- **Bundled scripts** — `soma-theme.sh` seeds on init, breadcrumbs added to all bundled scripts for docs and community references.
- **`_first-breath.md`** — added self-exploration guidance (agent reads its own docs), breath cycle explanation, learn-the-user prompts.
- **`_memory.md`** — added Step 1.5 (update living docs), Before You Start (conditional loading), corrections emphasis.

### Fixed
- **CHANGELOG auto-append bug** — post-commit hook was appending to every section, not just [0.12.2] — 2026-04-17. Rewrote hook, cleaned 172 duplicate entries.
- **Boot version-bump race** — version was bumped before notification, causing re-check loops. Now bumps after Tier 1 fixes complete.
- **CLI help header** — shows "CLI v0.2.0" instead of bare version number.
- **Dev mode health check** — no longer reports false "git repo has issues" in development.
- **Tier 1 body scaffold** — adds missing body files to existing `body/` directory (was only creating on fresh init).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **`soma --help` rewrite** — Soma-branded help with session commands, project commands, options, and TUI slash commands. Replaces generic Pi help output.
- **`soma --help scripts`** — show installed scripts with descriptions. Works from CLI and inside sessions.
- **`soma --help commands`** — full command reference organized by category (CLI, session, heat, hub, info).
- **`soma-theme.sh` bundled** — shared script theming now seeds on init (was a missing dependency for 3 bundled scripts).

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **Scripts crash on fresh projects** — `source soma-theme.sh` with `set -e` caused fatal exit when theme file wasn't present. Fixed with `if [ -f ]; then source; fi` pattern across all 8 scripts.
- **`soma focus <keyword>` didn't start session** — `main()` call wasn't awaited, `process.exit(0)` ran before session could start.
- **`postinstall.js` missing from builds** — deleted during Pi 0.64.0 dist sync, restored to CLI repo. Added to `OUR_DIST_FILES` and release script.
- **Docs: `/inhale` vs `soma inhale` confusion** — commands.md and getting-started.md now clearly distinguish CLI commands (shell) from TUI slash commands, with comparison table.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard** — warns when no preload exists (suggests `/exhale`), warns when preload is stale (>5 tool calls since write). Use `/inhale --force` to override.
- **Slash command usage hints** — 10 commands now include `Usage:` patterns in their descriptions: `/pin`, `/kill`, `/auto-commit`, `/inhale`, `/install`, `/auto-breathe`, `/hub`, `/scratch`, `/keepalive`, `/soul-space`, `/soma`.
- **Hub: 5 new scripts** — soma-seam, soma-reflect, soma-query, soma-focus, soma-plans. All with coaching-voice digests.
- **Hub: soma-code v2.0.0** — added `blast` (blast radius analysis), `tsc-errors` (TypeScript errors with context), improved `refs` (DEF/IMP/USE), improved `find` (extension filter).
- **Scripts docs** — `scripts.md` rewritten with hub links for each script.

### Changed
- **Upstream sync R4** — Pi 0.63.1 → 0.64.0. New APIs: `setHiddenThinkingLabel`, `signal`/`getSignal`, `prepareArguments`, async `getArgumentCompletions`.
- **Core scripts trimmed** — init seeds 5 core scripts (soma-code, soma-seam, soma-focus, soma-update-check, validate-content). Others available via `soma hub install script <name>`.
- **Semver discipline** — feature releases now bump minor version (0.X.0). Patch (0.x.Y) reserved for bug-fix-only releases.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **Changelog hook** — `soma-dev.sh` post-commit hook now targets only the first `### Added`/`### Fixed` section (was appending to all version sections).
- **Hub table rendering** — markdown tables in hub detail pages now render with proper `<table>`/`<thead>`/`<tbody>` structure.
- **Community CI clean** — 21 frontmatter fixes across protocols and muscles (missing breadcrumb, tier, license, author, version fields).
- **Script drift** — 7 scripts synced from working copies to agent repo (soma-code v1→v2, soma-reflect, soma-seam, soma-scrape, soma-spell, soma-plans, soma-query).
- **Hub scripts sanitized** — private paths (Gravicity, vault) stripped from soma-seam.sh.

---

## [0.6.7] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **`/soma doctor`** — migration command. Detects version mismatch on boot, prompts to run migration script with confirmation, shows output, reloads settings. Post-migration guidance for body file review.
- **Boot migration check** — notifies when project `.soma/` version is behind agent version.
- **Global vs parent detection** — `detectProjectContext()` distinguishes `~/.soma/` (global runtime) from real parent workspaces. Init prompt has three-way messaging: real parent choice, global fallback, or no soma.
- **Monorepo-aware first breath** — detects multi-repo projects, lists sub-projects with detected stacks. Points agent to `soma-code.sh structure` for orientation.
- **First-breath tool hints** — all first-breath messages include `soma-code.sh` and `soma-seam.sh` usage examples.
- **Body template scaffolding** — `body.md` (Project, Structure, Workflow, Current Focus sections) and `voice.md` (Delivery, Tone, Rhythm sections) ship with header scaffolding and comment breadcrumbs.
- **Richer `_memory.md`** — preload template now includes Weather, Who You Were, Orient From, Do NOT Re-Read sections.
- **Stash checkpoint style** — `checkpoints.project.style: "stash"` now wired. Uses `git stash push --include-untracked` with session ID.
- **Migration system** — `v0.6.6-to-v0.6.7.md` map + `migrate-0.6.6-to-0.6.7.sh` script. Handles settings, body templates, protocols. Backs up before replacing, skips customized files.

### Changed
- **System prompt budget** — default `systemPrompt.maxTokens` raised from 4000 to 10000. Anthropic's system prompt is ~25k; ours at ~5k was triggering false warnings.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **Preload resume false-positive** — `soma -c` no longer falsely detects preloads from previous rotations as "written this session." Uses mtime check (2-min threshold).
- **Body template instructions** — moved from frontmatter `description:` (invisible to agent) to HTML comment breadcrumbs in file body (visible, replaceable).
- **Migration script path resolution** — resolves bundled templates relative to script location, works in sandbox/dev/installed contexts.

---

## [0.6.6] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **Init UX** — prompt before auto-scaffolding (`ctx.ui.confirm`), parent .soma/ inheritance when user declines, `scaffoldBody` templateDir priority chain. (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)
- **Command provenance** — `/soma status` shows which extension registered each command via Pi's `sourceInfo`. (SX-233)
- **cli.js tracked source** — `src/cli.js` in agent repo is source of truth. `sync-to-cli.sh` and `soma-release.sh` use it. (SX-252)
- **Protocol coaching voice** — 14/17 protocol TL;DRs rewritten from spec/documentation voice to coaching voice. (SX-109)

### Changed
- **Upstream sync R3** — Pi 0.61.1 → 0.63.1 (71 commits, 3 releases). SourceInfo provenance, built-in tools as extensions, multi-edit, sessionDir, compaction fixes. 0 breaking changes on our imports. (SX-230)
- **Stale branches cleaned** — deleted `feat/docs-system`, `feat/runtime` (archived to patches), `protocol-quality-pass`, `feature/ship-breath-cycle`. Agent repo: dev + main + backup only.
- **scaffoldBody** priority chain: templateDir → bundled `_public/` → bundled `body/`.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- `/soma prompt` diagnostic checked for "Learned Patterns" but actual heading is "Muscle Memory".

## [0.6.5] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **`soma inhale --list`** — show available preloads with age and staleness markers from CLI.
- **`soma inhale <name>`** — partial name match. Load a specific preload by date, session ID, or any substring. Ambiguous matches show alternatives.
- **`soma inhale --load <path>`** — load any file as a preload by absolute or relative path.
- **`soma map <name>`** — top-level subcommand replacing `--map` flag. Runs a MAP with prompt-config and targeted preload.
- **`soma map --list`** — show available MAPs with status and description from CLI.
- **`/soma preload`** (in-session) — enhanced to list all preloads + inject by partial name match.
- **`listPreloads()`** + **`findPreloadByName()`** in `core/preload.ts` — preload discovery and partial name matching.
- **Settings-driven heat overrides** (`settings.heat.overrides`) — per-project AMPS heat control. Values act as both seed and decay floor. Plan/MAP overrides take priority. (`31e1383`)
- **`inherit.automations`** — separate from tools inheritance, allows projects to opt out of parent MAPs independently. (`3f01343`)
- **Statusline preload indicator** — shows preload status in footer. Smart `/exhale` detects edit vs write mode. (`76cd246`)
- **Auto-archive stale preloads** after exhale — `archiveStalePreloads()` moves old preloads to `_archive/`. (`7f2f086`)
- **Restart signal** — auto-create `.restart-required` on extension/core file changes, check across full soma chain. Signal moved to `~/.soma/` (global). (`14d0253`, `635d36e`, `e252a63`)

### Changed
- **`--preload` flag deprecated** — shows warning pointing to `soma inhale` or `soma map`. Still works for backward compat.
- **Boot greeting decomposed** — session ID and file paths now separate template variables. (`4d8331f`)

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **Crash on partial settings** — `settings.heat.overrides` access without optional chaining crashed when `heat` section missing. Now defensive. (`b837a37`)
- **Breathe graceSeconds mismatch** — runtime fallback was 60s, settings default was 30s. Aligned to 30s. (`b837a37`)
- **5 auto-breathe UX gaps** — smart context warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic for preload detection. (`0f86bec`)

---

## [0.6.4] — 2026-03-23

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **Body architecture** — structured identity system. `.soma/body/` with content files (`soul.md` → `{{soul}}`, `voice.md` → `{{voice}}`, `body.md` → `{{body}}`) and templates (`_mind.md`, `_memory.md`, `_boot.md`). Content files become template variables. Templates control system prompt and preload structure.
- **Template engine** (`core/body.ts`) — `{{variable}}` interpolation with 5 modifiers (`|tldr`, `|section:Name`, `|lines:N`, `|last:N`, `|ref`), conditional blocks (`{{#var}}...{{/var}}`), graceful degradation for missing vars.
- **AMPS Skill Loader** (`core/skill-loader.ts`) — unified content scanner. All AMPS classified by heat: hot (8+) = full body in prompt, warm (3-7) = `<available_skills>` XML (agent reads on demand), cold (0-2) = hidden. Claude's native skill format.
- **`/body` command** — template inspector with 4 subcommands: `check` (health report), `vars` (all variables by category), `map` (template structure), `render` (full compiled system prompt, fresh from disk).
- **Variable registry** — 50+ template variables categorized (context, identity, section, boot, session, focus, metadata, preload-tpl, deprecated) with essential flags and descriptions.
- **`SOMA.md`** replaces `identity.md` as canonical identity file. Resolution: `body/soul.md` → `SOMA.md` → `identity.md` (legacy fallback).
- **`body.md`** — project-shaped working context variable (`{{body}}`). Changes per project, placed anywhere in `_mind.md`.
- **First-breath template** — conditional blocks (`{{#has_code}}`, `{{#is_blank}}`) for first-run experience.
- **`/exit`** command — save state and quit cleanly.
- **Boot greetings** rewritten — "You woke up" not "You've booted into a session."
- **Header bar** shows soul/body status indicators.
- **`soma-verify.sh drift`** — `_public/` sync check across protocols, muscles, body files, community repo, and agent repo.
- **`systemPrompt.maxTokens`** wired as soft warning — notification when compiled prompt exceeds budget.
- **Muscle heat bumps on load** — muscles that stay relevant gain heat naturally (+1 per boot). Previously only bumped when explicitly read.
- **Body file inheritance** — content files and templates walk the soma chain (project → parent → global). Child wins on collision.
- **`user.name`**, `user.style` settings with `{{user_name}}`, `{{user_style}}` variables.

### Changed
- **System prompt** driven by `body/_mind.md` template when present. Users control structure, sections, custom text. Falls back to built-in compiler.
- **Warm AMPS** appear as `<available_skills>` XML alongside Pi native skills — Claude's trained format for lazy-loaded content.
- **`prompts/system-core.md`** — removed explicit context percentages (50/70/80/85%). Auto-breathe handles thresholds; agent shouldn't guess.
- **AMPS cleanup** — 44 → 34 active muscles (10 archived), 9 → 2 high-overlap triggers (16 cleaned), 34/34 have descriptions.
- **Docs sweep** — 9 pages updated for body architecture, SOMA.md, skill loader, template engine, removed gendered pronouns.
- **`sync-docs.sh`** manifest expanded — 10 new docs added (focus, maps, sessions, prompts, skills, settings, themes, keybindings, models, terminal-setup).
- **Protocol test** accepts `description:` alongside `breadcrumb:` (migration compat).
- **Sandbox test** updated for 8 extensions, 19 protocols, SOMA.md init.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**
- **Conversation tail injection removed** — was scanning stale Pi JSONL sessions from wrong runtime, sidetracking agent with old conversations.
- **Soul frontmatter leaking** into rendered system prompt — `loadIdentity()` now strips YAML frontmatter.
- **Duplicate `# Identity` heading** — `buildLayeredIdentity()` no longer hardcodes heading; template handles it.
- **`_public/` drift** — 22 files synced across community + agent repos. Drift detection tool built.
- **Boot message duplication** — stripped content already in system prompt from boot followUp.
- **`/body render`** compiles fresh from disk each time (was using stale boot cache).

### Internal
- **`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`** in `core/body.ts` — complete registry of all template variables with categories, essential flags, descriptions.
- **`core/skill-loader.ts`** — `LoadableContent` interface, `loadAllContent()`, `formatAsSkillsXml()`.
- **`compileWithTemplate()`** — template path in `compileFullSystemPrompt()`, shared section builders.
- **`getDefaultMindTemplate()`**, `getDefaultBootTemplate()` — built-in fallback templates.
- **`loadFirstBreath()`** — conditional first-run template with chain inheritance.
- **52 block variables** tested (77/77 body tests + 19 E2E).
- **Frontmatter-kit** — 9 scripts for bulk AMPS frontmatter operations (extract, writeback, sort, migrate, audit).
- **`preload.lastMessages`** setting removed (conversation tail scanner was the only consumer).

---

## [0.6.3] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **settings-driven heat overrides — per-project AMPS control**
- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**
- **`/hub` command** — unified hub interface for community content. Install, fork, share, find, list, status. Replaces old `/install` and `/list` commands (kept as backward compat aliases).
- **Smart sharing** (`/hub share`) — quality scoring (0-100%), privacy auto-fix with `_public/` staging, README generation that captures `--help` output and extracts functions, dependency resolution.
- **Drop-in commands** — scripts in `.soma/amps/scripts/commands/` become `/soma <name>` commands. Hot-loadable, no restart needed. Tab completions included.
- **`scope: core` protocols** — documentation protocols whose behavior is coded in TypeScript. Never loaded into prompt (saves ~2000 tokens). Discoverable, readable on demand via docs section. `/pin` and `/kill` block with explanation.
- **5 core protocols** — breath-cycle, heat-tracking, session-checkpoints, git-identity, hub-sharing.
- **`automation` content type** — MAPs are now installable hub content. 3 published: debug, refactor, visual-gap-analysis.
- **Dependency resolution** — `requires:` in frontmatter auto-installs dependencies (scripts, protocols, muscles) alongside content.
- **`gitIdentity.email` array support** — multiple valid emails for multi-account users.
- **Default preload template** — Weather (emotional tone) + Warnings (traps for next session) sections.
- **Preload template** on community hub — customizable preload format.
- **Regression test suite** — test-hub.sh (25 tests) + test-commands.sh (26 tests). Side-effect testing for `-p` mode.

### Changed
- **Hub: 40 items** across 5 content types (17 protocols, 8 muscles, 3 scripts, 3 automations, 9 templates).
- **`/soma prompt`** shows core protocols with 📄 icon instead of misleading heat display.
- **Bundled protocols** updated with shipped tool references (soma-code, soma-scrape, soma-spell).
- **Community CI** — validate-frontmatter accepts `triggers` (replaces `topic`+`keywords`), `description` OR `breadcrumb`. Format-check supports `scope: core`. Attribution allows org identity for owners. Actions upgraded to v6 (Node 22).

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**
- **`/hub list --remote`** — flag was parsed as type filter, returning 0 results.
- **Drop-in command output** — ANSI escape codes stripped (sendUserMessage renders markdown, not terminal).
- **Stale git-identity heat rule** removed from HEAT_RULES (protocol was archived).
- **soma-refactor.sh scan** — string references now exclude node_modules/dist/.git.

### Security
- **soma-beta** — `.map` files (128) and `.d.ts` files (64) stripped from dist. Source maps contained full `sourcesContent`.
- **soma-beta** — orphan history on every release. Old commits can't recover source code.

### Internal
- 7-phase dev cycle MAP (soma-dev/cycle.md with phase files)
- Blog content cycle MAP (blog/cycle.md with phase files)
- SVG blog diagrams muscle (Soma palette, transparent bg, rsvg-convert pipeline)
- Migration v0.6.2→v0.6.3 updated for scope:core + git-identity restore
- FRONTMATTER.md rewritten, CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- 185 unit test assertions (was 162), 51 regression tests

## [0.6.2] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **settings-driven heat overrides — per-project AMPS control**
- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**
- **Natural muscle heat detection** — muscles now heat-bump from natural use, not just focus. Script execution matches against `tools:` field. File edits match path segments against `triggers`. Zero configuration needed.
- **Migration system** — `version` field in settings.json. `core/migrations.ts` discovers and chains migration maps. `soma doctor` checks workspace health. `soma doctor --fix` auto-repairs. `soma doctor --migrate` spawns agent for complex fixes.
- **Community template sync** — boot fetches latest protocols from community repo. Bundled protocols serve as offline fallback. Add content to community → add name to template → all new users get it.
- **`tools:` field** in muscle frontmatter — declares which scripts a muscle references. Parsed and used for natural heat detection.

### Changed
- **Triggers consolidation** — `triggers` + `keywords` + `topic` merged into single `triggers` list at parse time. `tags` stays for categorization only. Old format works indefinitely (backwards compat).
- **Muscle interface simplified** — one activation list instead of four redundant fields with different score weights.
- **Personality engine** — welcome flow is honest about being templates, not the agent.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**
- **Runtime delegation** — soma-beta now includes cli.js and Pi runtime files. Previously thin-cli fell through to raw Pi (no version skip, no auto-rotate, "Update Available" banner).
- **Fresh installs** now include version field in settings.json.
- **Stale test assertions** — test suite checked for removed frontmatter fields and nonexistent commands.

### Internal
- soma-theme.sh, soma-rebrand.sh, soma-switch.sh dev mode, soma-doctor.sh
- script-polish + github-theming muscles
- 7 repo READMEs refreshed, post-release MAP created
- License date corrected to 2027-09-18, contact standardised to meetsoma@gravicity.ai
- Dangerous CI disabled (release-publish.yml shipped full source on v* tags)

- `--help` fixed — `printGumHelp` removed in 0.61.0, replaced with `printHelp`
- Heat system docs: `.protocol-state.json` → `state.json` across 6 files, 3 repos
- Protocols page: collapsed 60-line heat duplication to reference, renamed "Protocols & Heat" → "Protocols"

#### MAP System — Plan-Driven Agent Orchestration
- `maps.ts` — MAP discovery + prompt-config YAML parser (#1039512)
- `PlanPromptConfig` — plan-driven system prompt overrides: heat overrides, force-include/exclude, section toggles, budget overrides, supplementary identity (#28d71fe)
- `soma --map <name>` — MAP targeting via `.boot-target` signal file. Loads prompt-config, targeted preload, and MAP content as navigation context (#a12709e)
- 18 tests for MAP parser + plan override compilation (#df835cb)

#### Focus Targeting — Seam-Traced Boot
- `soma-focus.sh` — pre-model seam-traced boot priming. Traces keyword through memory, scores relevance, generates `.boot-target` with heat overrides (#116c4bb)
- Focus handler in `soma-boot.ts` — `type: "focus"` .boot-target support. Loads focus preload, related MAPs (max 3), focus summary (#2f7d302)
- Muscle trigger engine — `triggers:` frontmatter parsed and matched at boot. Muscles auto-activate when focus keyword matches their tags, keywords, topics, or explicit triggers (#1bc1c57)
- `matchMusclesToFocus()` — TypeScript-native muscle matching with scored relevance (10=trigger, 5=tag/keyword, 4=topic, 3=name, 2=digest) (#1bc1c57)
- `trackMapRun()` — programmatic MAP usage tracking. Auto-increments `runs:` and updates `last-run:` in frontmatter when MAP loads via .boot-target (#893f176)

#### Scripts — Agent Tools That Ship
- **5 Tier 1 scripts** now ship with Soma and are seeded on `soma init` (#116c4bb):
  - `soma-code.sh` — multi-language codebase navigator (map, find, refs, replace, structure, tsc-errors)
  - `soma-seam.sh` — trace concepts through memory, code, and sessions
  - `soma-focus.sh` — seam-traced boot priming
  - `soma-reflect.sh` — parse session logs for patterns and observations
  - `soma-plans.sh` — plan lifecycle management
- `scaffoldScripts()` in `init.ts` — copies bundled scripts to `.soma/amps/scripts/` on init (#116c4bb)
- `ensureGlobalSoma()` — bootstraps `~/.soma/` with AMPS layout on first boot. Seeds scripts, creates global identity template. Idempotent. (#47422e8)
- Protocol scope fix — 5 protocols changed from hub/internal to bundled for proper CLI distribution (#47422e8)
- Recursive AMPS discovery — muscles, protocols, scripts, MAPs now scan subdirectories (max 2 levels). Directories with `_` or `.` prefix are skipped. Enables organized layouts: `muscles/ui/`, `scripts/dev/`, `maps/runtime/` (#c36dcd0)
- Identity template enhanced — 5 working patterns (read-before-write, scripts-first, verify-before-claiming, corrections-as-signal, log-your-work) in both built-in and smart templates (#98035e9)
- `soma-pr.sh` moved to `_dev/` — requires GitHub App secrets users don't have (#98035e9)
- `soma-scrape.sh` — intelligent doc discovery + scraping (resolve, pull, search, discover). Requires gh, curl, jq (#18e5bde)
- `soma-query.sh` — unified search replacing soma-scan + soma-search. Commands: find, list, search, sessions, related, impact (#5604f2a)
- `/scan-logs --send` flag — injects search results into agent conversation (#1f891a5)

#### Guard & Safety
- Worktree boundary enforcement — hard-block writes outside allowed worktree path (#961f2bc)
- Soul-space command gated behind `.gate.md` file (#2b0d819)

#### Agent Infrastructure
- PR template, agent contribution standards for GitHub App bot PRs (#743b48d)
- Soul-space mode — `/soul-space on` replaces keepalive with MLR prompts (#caea905)
- TypeScript type checking (`npm run check`) + biome linting (`npm run lint`) (#20ab881)

#### Identity & Protocols
- Identity bootstrap with 4 sections: This Project, Voice, How I Work, Review & Evolve (#c5086ea)
- `response-style` protocol — set voice, length, emoji, and format preferences (#50aee8a)
- Dignity clause in `correction-capture` — acknowledge without over-apologizing (#50aee8a)
- `maps` protocol — teaches MAP system: check before tasks, build after repeated processes (#4a85b53)
- `plan-hygiene` protocol — plan lifecycle: status tracking, ≤12 active budget, verify before claiming (#4a85b53)
- `soma inhale` CLI subcommand — fresh session with preload from last session (#f61064f)
- `soma` (no args) now starts clean — no preload injection (#f61064f)
- User interrupt detection during auto-breathe — 1st interrupt resets timer, 2nd cancels (#d530af8)

- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**

- Auto-breathe mode — proactive context management that triggers wrap-up at configurable %, auto-rotates at higher %. Safety net at 85% always on. Opt-in via `breathe.auto` in settings (#1d533bf)
- `/auto-breathe` command — runtime toggle (`on|off|status`), persists to settings.json
- Smarter `/breathe` — context-aware instructions (light/full/urgent), handles preload-already-written and timeout edge cases
- Cold-start muscle boost — muscles created <48h get +3 effective heat for at least 2 sessions
- Orient-from preloads — preload template includes `## Orient From` pointing to files next session should read first
- `soma:recall` event signal — extensions can listen for context pressure events (steno integration)
- `/auto-commit` command — toggle `.soma/` auto-commit on exhale/breathe (`on|off|status`)
- Auto-commit `.soma/` state — changes committed to local git on every exhale/breathe via `checkpoints.soma.autoCommit`
- `/pin` and `/kill` invalidate prompt cache — heat changes take effect next turn, not next session
- `/soma prompt` diagnostic — shows compiled sections, identity status, heat levels, context %, runtime state
- `sync-to-cli.sh` and `sync-to-website.sh` — one-command repo sync scripts
- `soma-compat.sh` — detect protocol/muscle overlap, redundancy, directive conflicts
- `soma-update-check.sh` — compare local protocol/muscle versions against hub
- `/scratch` command — quick notes to `.soma/scratchpad.md`, append-only, agent doesn't see unless `/scratch read`
- `guard.bashCommands` setting — `allow`/`warn`/`block` for dangerous bash command prompts
- Automations system — `.soma/automations/` for step-by-step procedural flows
- Polyglot script discovery — boot discovers `.sh`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.mjs` scripts with auto-extracted descriptions
- `soma init --orphan` — `--orphan`/`-o` flag for clean child projects with zero parent inheritance
- Git hooks: `post-commit` auto-changelog + `pre-push` docs-drift nudge
- Bundled protocols: `correction-capture` + `detection-triggers` — learning-agent protocols

### Changed

- Config-first script extensions — `settings.scripts.extensions` controls which file types are discovered
- Command cleanup — removed `/flush`, folded `/preload` into `/soma preload` and `/debug` into `/soma debug`
- CI improvements — PR check and release workflows now run all test suites

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**

- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**

- System prompt dropped after turn 1 — Pi resets each `before_agent_start`, now caches compiled prompt
- Identity never in compiled prompt — `isPiDefaultPrompt()` checked wrong string
- Context warnings never fired — `getContextUsage()` returns undefined on turn 1, handled gracefully
- Identity lost after `/auto-continue` or `/breathe` — `session_switch` now rebuilds from chain
- Guard false positive on `2>/dev/null` — stderr redirects no longer trigger write warnings
- Bash guard false positive on `>>` — append redirects no longer trigger dangerous redirect guard
- Preload auto-injected on continue/resume — `soma -c` and `soma -r` no longer inject stale preloads
- `/soma prompt` crash — `getProtocolHeat` import missing
- Audit false positives — all 11 audit scripts improved across the board

- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**

- PII scrubbed from git history across all repos
- CLI stripped to distribution only — agent is source of truth

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **settings-driven heat overrides — per-project AMPS control**
- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**

- Protocols and Heat System — behavioral rules loaded by temperature, heat rises through use, decays through neglect
- Muscle loading at boot — sorted by heat, loaded within configurable token budget
- Settings chain — `settings.json` with resolution: project → parent → global
- Mid-session heat tracking — auto-detects protocol usage from tool results
- Domain scoping — `applies-to` frontmatter + `detectProjectSignals()`
- Breath cycle commands — `/exhale`, `/inhale`, `/pin`, `/kill`
- Script awareness — boot surfaces `.soma/scripts/` inventory
- 9 core modules — discovery, identity, protocols, muscles, settings, init, preload, utils, index

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**

- Extensions load correctly
- Skills install to correct path

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-08

### Born

- σῶμα (sōma) — *Greek for "body."* The vessel that grows around you.
- Built on Pi with `piConfig.configDir: ".soma"`
- Identity system: `.soma/identity.md` — discovered, not configured
- Memory structure: `.soma/memory/` — muscles, sessions, preloads
- Breath cycle concept: sessions exhale what was learned, next session inhales it
- 9 core modules, 4 extensions, logo through 36 SVG iterations
