## [Unreleased] — 


### Fixed
- **promote Unreleased → 0.41.0, add fresh Unreleased section**
## [0.41.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Delegation goes multi-model.** Child roles no longer default to a single Claude model —
  13 roles now carry a `model-chain` in frontmatter spanning Mistral, Gemini, Cohere, and Groq,
  with automatic fallback on rate-limit or failure, and a configurable global default
  (`settings.json` → `delegate.defaultModel`). Every delegate call now prints the resolved model
  and where it came from (explicit arg / role default / settings.json / built-in fallback) before
  spawning, and a `deliverable:` field in role frontmatter injects a hard write-to-disk rule when
  a child owes a file on disk. Free-tier children get a keepalive note so they don't mistake
  `[cache keepalive]` pings for real tasks (s01-0e4632).
- **System prompt budget guardrail.** Project setting `maxTokens: 17000` warns when the compiled
  prompt exceeds budget, enforcing the lean-body discipline from the recent soul/voice/core_rules
  cuts (s01-639c5f).
- **State-disk sync muscle.** Documents the drift pattern where moving or deleting a body file
  under `_archive/` leaves a ghost entry in `state.json`; proposes a boot-time prune (s01-639c5f).

### Changed
- **Delegate defaults flipped to free-tier.** `default-model` for child templates moved off
  `claude-sonnet-4-6`/`claude-haiku-4-5` onto Mistral (`mistral-large-2512` for quality,
  `ministral-8b-2512` for speed), with the same swap in the `spawnBackground` fallback chain.
  Delegate help text and `docs/guides/background-delegation.md` now list Mistral first and mark
  Claude models as premium-with-billing-note (s01-0e4632).
- **Pi runtime: 0.80.6 → 0.80.10.** Four patch versions. `AuthStorage` was removed from the SDK
  in favor of `readStoredCredential`; `edit-diff.js` was re-forked against the new base. tsc clean,
  sandbox 106/106.
- **Release script hardening.** `soma-release-ship.sh` now auto-updates `_kanban.md`'s
  current-version-public after a ship instead of leaving it stale, and two surface/infra tests
  (`test-sx777-narrative-final.sh`, `test-soma-github-local-runtime.sh`) are marked
  `@release-state` so pre-existing drift in them stops blocking `prepare` with a hard conflict.

### Fixed
- **mark test-doctor as release-state (surface check)**
- **Anthropic OAuth billing gate.** Soma's compiled system prompt now opens with
  `"You are an expert coding assistant."` — matching Pi's default identity — before Soma's own
  identity block. Freshly-issued OAuth tokens were hitting a `billing_error` on Anthropic's Beta
  Sessions API because non-standard agent identities get classified as third-party harness usage.
  May still need extra-usage billing enabled at claude.ai/settings/usage if Anthropic tightens
  long-context classification further.
- **Body lean-out — 62% smaller.** soul.md 9.2K→3.7K, voice.md 8.6K→3.4K, core_rules.md 8.9K→2.6K,
  body.md 11.1K→4.5K. Four concepts (ground-before, probes, corrections, tool discipline) that were
  each narrated 3-4× across files got a single canonical home. System prompt down from ~26K to
  ~16-17K tokens (s01-639c5f).
- **Muscle archive — 147→63 muscles.** 56 dead muscles (heat=0, never applied) moved to
  `_archive/`; 24 matching ghost entries purged from `state.json`, saving ~3-4K tokens of muscle
  digest per boot (s01-639c5f).
- **`/body` detector false positives.** Unreferenced body files now collapse into one warning
  instead of one per file; backtick-quoted code and fenced blocks are stripped before `{{var}}`
  extraction so prose mentions stop triggering it; authoring scaffolds (`_*-template.md`) are
  excluded from template-variable validation (s01-639c5f).
- **Delegate + Pi 0.80.x compat.** Delegate calls were hitting `ARG_MAX` passing the system prompt
  inline; switched to `--system-prompt-file` with a temp file, and updated Pi's import paths for
  the 0.80.x restructuring. Stale preloads no longer leak into child processes, and boot warnings
  were fixed alongside.
- **sx794 test suite** updated for the `--system-prompt-file` change, gained a template version
  check, and had its reports moved out of the roles directory.

## [0.40.0] — 2026-07-13


### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **'soma install npm:<pkg>' pass-through to Pi package manager + hub shows pi.dev (s01-2b2368)**
- **{{enabled_models}} template variable — scoped models at boot (s01-2b2368)**
- **pi.dev package search — soma:extensions.search + .show (s01-2b2368)**
- **{{active_extensions}} template variable — auto-discovered at boot (s01-2b2368)**
- **extensions list cap + body-parts dedup + discovered-vs-core split (s01-2b2368)**
- **dynamic delegate model catalog + body parts auto-discovery (s01-2b2368)**

### Fixed
- **soma:agent.models now shows enabled/scoped models from settings.json (s01-2b2368)**
- **sync core/ in soma-dev + add {{active_extensions}} to project _mind.md (s01-2b2368)**
- **guard fix.sh against missing AGENT_DIR in wrong workspace**

## [0.39.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma:refdocs — General-purpose external docs fetcher.** Discover + fetch ANY external platform docs
  as clean markdown using the `llms.txt` convention (Cloudflare, Vercel, React, and 25+ known domains).
  Four caps: `refdocs.find` discovers the source, `refdocs.tree` shows the organized structure,
  `refdocs.fetch` gets a single page, `refdocs.download` bulk-fetches to `.soma/refdocs/<name>/`
  with section-organized `.md` files and an index. Bundled with Soma.
- **soma:cf-docs — Cloudflare developer docs cap family.** Query CF docs as clean markdown with
  no API key. Three caps: `index`, `read`, `query`. Hub package (`soma install`).
- **Freebuff harness — $0 AI model access.** Headless freebuff sessions in tmux, programmatic
  prompt→response via JSON extraction from `chat-messages.json`. Six free models available
  (DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash, MiniMax M3, Kimi K2.7, MiMo 2.5/Pro). Dev-only tool.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime: 0.79.6 → 0.80.6.** 13 versions (0.79.7–0.79.10, 0.80.1–0.80.6). New features
  available: `max` thinking level, `showCacheMissNotices` toggle, extension hooks
  (`agent_settled`, `before_provider_headers`), `pi config -l` for project-local config,
  Claude Sonnet 5, GPT-5.6 family. edit-diff patch re-forked for surgical fuzzy matching.
  Build verified: tests green, sandbox 106/106, TUI smoke with free model.

### Fixed
- **Freebuff parser: TUI scraping → JSON extraction.** Line-wrapping in `tmux capture-pane` broke
  multi-paragraph responses. Switched to reading freebuff's `chat-messages.json` for clean,
  wrapping-immune output. TUI parsing retained as fallback.
- **Pi 0.80.6 compat fixes.** Fixed `setBedrockProviderModule` import path (moved in 0.80.0 API
  restructuring) and duplicate `baseContent` declaration in re-forked edit-diff.
- **edit-diff.soma.js cleanup.** Removed dead `countOccurrences` (superseded by `findEditSpan`),
  documented trailing-whitespace quirk in fuzzy matching.


## [0.38.0] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **script subcommands must use clean userArgs, not injected argv (SX-811)**
- **serialize browser-driving caps — concurrency race**

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma:caselaw.* — Caselaw Researcher cap family**
<!-- Entries accumulate here and get promoted to a versioned section on release. -->

### Changed
- **Internal: removed the dead `systemPromptBlock` protocol renderer (SX-806).** `buildProtocolInjection`
  (`core/protocols.ts`) assembled a `## Active Protocols` / `## Protocol Awareness` / `## Available
  Protocols` / `## Core Protocols` string block on every boot that had **no production consumer** — the
  live system prompt renders protocols via two other paths: `prompt.ts compileFrontalCortex` → `## Active
  Behavioral Rules` (TL;DR summaries, hot+warm) and `soma-boot.ts` → `## Hot Protocols (full reference)`
  (from `injection.hot`). Removed the `systemPromptBlock` field, its ~40-line assembly, and the test
  assertions that exercised it (`test-protocols.sh` §9 systemPromptBlock checks + the §9b breadcrumb-
  fallback test). No user-facing behavior change — the compiled boot prompt is byte-identical.


## [0.37.1] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Exiting a session no longer garbles your shell (SX-808).** Two soma-driven exits — the keepalive idle
  shutdown ("shutting down to prevent zombie session") and the `/exit` command — called `process.exit(0)`
  directly, bypassing the TUI teardown that restores the terminal. Your shell was left in the Kitty keyboard
  protocol, so the next thing you typed (`soma -c`, `soma inhale`, …) rendered as garbage like
  `so15;1:3um11;1:3u`. Both now route through a shared graceful shutdown (`core/shutdown.ts`) that triggers
  the runtime's own teardown via SIGTERM — restoring cooked mode, the cursor, and disabling the
  Kitty/bracketed-paste/modifyOtherKeys sequences before exiting. Two regression guards ship with the fix: a
  Pi-upstream contract check (fails loudly if the runtime ever stops handling SIGTERM gracefully) and a
  static scan that flags ANY naked timer-driven `process.exit()` in an extension — the bug shape — going
  forward. (The scan caught the `/exit` instance the moment it was added.)


## [0.37.0] — 2026-06-23

### Changed
- **The system prompt was split along a scaffold-vs-behavior line.** `prompts/system-core.md` (the always-
  loaded framework harness, identical on every install) is now **pure scaffold** — session mechanics, the
  memory tree, tool-discovery, docs, commands, rhythm, and *pointers* to the behavioral layer. **All
  behavioral rules now live in `core_rules.md`** — a body file you own and tune (ours-vs-theirs like
  `soul.md` / `voice.md`). Four behaviors moved from system-core into the `core_rules` seed: **Match the
  Codebase · Name the Approach · Mark Reversals, Don't Delete · Guard Secrets, Refuse Harm.** Why: the
  always-loaded scaffold stays lean and universal, while the behavioral layer becomes yours to shape — the
  same separation `soul`/`voice` already have. Existing installs keep their `core_rules` untouched; an
  **agent-run migration** (`migrations/phases/v0.36.0-to-v0.37.0.md`, `fix-mode: agent`) diffs the new seed
  against yours and merges the missing behaviors, preserving every customization (never a mechanical clobber).
- **SX-805 — v0.37.0 template-migration plumbing.** The `core_rules.md` and `_protocol-template.md` seeds
  bumped to 0.37.0 (core_rules gained the 4 behavior sections; the protocol template moved `## Summary` →
  `## TL;DR` so warm-loading reads the right block). A `template-auto-update-v0.37.0` boot step auto-updates a
  **pristine** `_protocol-template.md` to the new content and **keeps a customized one** (byte-exact pristine
  check against the archived v0.36.0 seed — the anti-clobber guard). `core_rules.md` is user-owned and never
  auto-written; new installs get the full v0.37.0 set, existing installs migrate via the agent-run map above.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **`soma:browser.render` — render a JS-heavy / SPA page in an ephemeral tab and return its text (SX-807).**
  Static `fetch()` returns only a ~400-char shell on JS-rendered sites; this drives a real browser via raw
  CDP over WebSocket: create a throwaway tab → wait for hydration → read `innerText` (or `outerHTML`, or a
  CSS selector's content) → close the tab. **No bridge required**, and the ephemeral tab sidesteps the
  tab-UUID-registry churn. args: `{url, selector?, format?:'text'|'html', waitMs?(5000), keepOpen?}`. (Inherits
  bot-detection — CAPTCHA / Cloudflare can still block.)

### Fixed
- **`soma:browser.evaluate` + `.navigate` now fall back to raw CDP-WS when the bridge is down (SX-807).** The
  bridge proxies CDP control-plane ops, but it dies mid-session — and these caps used to hard-fail with
  "requires bridge" even though CDP itself (:9333) was still alive. Now they detect an unreachable bridge and
  talk CDP directly (resolving the target tab by id / url / title, else the first page). The bridge-up path is
  unchanged. The direct-CDP WebSocket helper rewrites the target host to the resolved config (127.0.0.1),
  avoiding the `localhost`→IPv6 (`::1`) footgun where a browser listening on IPv4 only is unreachable.
- **SX-794 — `soma:agent.delegate({ model:'claude-cli/*', background:true })` now actually runs.** Background
  delegation booted `soma --model claude-cli/sonnet` in the terminal pane, but `claude-cli/*` is a delegate
  *backend*, not a base-resolver model — the child died with "Model not found" and the task text leaked into
  the shell. The synchronous path already intercepted `claude-cli/*` (→ `claude -p`); the background path
  never reached that branch. Now `spawnBackground` detects a claude-cli backend and boots a real **`claude -p`
  one-shot** in the pane instead: the role's declared `default-tools` drive the allowlist (SX-801; read-only
  fallback when a role declares nothing), the role's compiled prompt rides as `--append-system-prompt`,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is blanked so it draws from the subscription (never silent extra-usage), and
  `--permission-mode acceptEdits` keeps a detached, non-interactive pane from hanging on a tool prompt. Task +
  prompt are passed via temp files referenced as `"$(cat …)"` so no user content is inlined into the
  send-keys command. Drivers gained a generic `SpawnOpts.bootCommand` (run verbatim instead of the default
  soma boot). Verified end-to-end: a background `builder` child wrote a file (Write) and ran a command (Bash)
  via `claude -p` in tmux. (root-cause handoff from a peer soma instance.)
- **scrub names from shipping .ts + close leak-scan .js gap**
- **block peer/client soma-instance names from soma-beta**


## [0.36.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **The always-loaded core (`system-core.md`) restructured + sharpened — generally useful for every agent.** Reorganized the behavioral guidance into a clear **Orient → Work → Remember** loop (was a flat 15-bullet wall), and added high-value beats every Soma benefits from: **read the docs** (Soma ships its own docs in `docs/`; `soma:docs.search <topic>` finds the right one — read + follow cross-references before reinventing, vs reconstructing from memory); **keep your body current** (when you change a file, update the body file that owns it — an un-updated body file lies to your next self); **match the codebase** (follow existing style, verify a library is actually used before assuming it, don't add unrequested comments); **guard secrets / refuse harm**; and **name the approach before a multi-step change**. The `body/*.md` files are now framed as the agent's living model of the project (`body.md` = index, domain files = grown knowledge). Lean throughout — denser, not longer.
- **System prompt now states the `.soma/` layout rule + that it commits itself.** Two recurring confusions
  got a one-line fix each in the always-loaded core prompt (`prompts/system-core.md`): (1) **stay in the
  lines** — new content goes in its standard home (`skills/`, `amps/{muscles,protocols,scripts,automations}/`,
  `releases/`, `memory/`), never a fresh top-level `.soma/` folder (which is almost always drift); (2)
  **`.soma/` auto-checkpoints** (`settings.checkpoints.soma.autoCommit`, on by default) — don't `git add`/`git
  commit` inside `.soma/` manually. Full layout reference in `docs/memory-layout.md` (now also notes the
  checkpoint behavior). Putting the canon in the always-loaded prompt (not a drift-prone protocol) is the fix:
  an unloaded rule drifts.
- **System prompt refined from corpus mining (the two most-recurring anti-patterns).** Mining session
  logs + preloads + soul-space surfaced two patterns the always-loaded core wasn't guarding: (1) a preload's
  *causal claims* ("FIXED"/"BLOCKED"/"dead") drift from its STATE and get chased stale (24 corpus files) —
  the "Trust the preload" guidance now distinguishes trustworthy STATE from the past-self THEORY to verify;
  (2) the *proxy drifts from the ground it stands for* (16 files + 2 soul-space syntheses) — "Run before
  theorize" now names `committed`≠pushed, `dist/`≠source, status-string≠real-state as the ground to probe.

### Changed
- **Preload format (`_memory.md` template) refined from dogfood — better briefings for your next self.** The preload template gained three sections proven in daily use: **`⛔ Ground Truth`** (settled facts + corrected beliefs the next self would otherwise waste time re-deriving — the anti-wander slot), **`Open Loops`** (numbered, prioritized forward blockers with a "start here if cold" marker), and **`Decisions Made`** (closed architectural choices, so the next session doesn't re-debate them). `Gaps`/`Unfinished`/`Prior Preloads` fold into an *Optional sections* note (add only if they carry weight), and `Warnings`+`Traps` merge into one. Existing **pristine** `_memory.md` files auto-update on first boot; a customized one is never touched. `soma_template_version` 0.35.0 → 0.36.0.
- **SX-804 (P5) — Tier-2 (somaverse) extension source consolidated into the agent repo; one factory, no cross-repo symlinks.** The somaverse extensions (`bridge-connect`, `hub-connect`, the `somaverse:*` meta-tool + addons) used to live in a sibling repo (`somaverse/builds/local/extensions/`) and were wired into agent sessions by symlinking their source into `.soma/extensions/` — a set that had **leaked into the meetsoma parent**, forcing somaverse's whole toolset (and a stale `dev`-tool extraction) into every agent-dev session (the boot-token surprise that opened this cycle). Source now lives in `repos/agent/extensions/somaverse/` (one home) and is consumed **only** as the obfuscated, auth-gated `.min.js` built by `build-extensions/build.sh` — no live `.ts` symlinks. The `meta-tool-factory` had **diverged 149 lines** across the two repos; somaverse now imports the agent's single-source factory (`../_shared`) directly — there is exactly one. `space-office` (+ its orphaned `neumann` DB layer) dropped to `_archive/`. Also fixes a **latent release bug** the divergence had masked: the release step overlaid somaverse's `_shared/meta-tool-factory.js` over the agent's canonical one ("byte-identical invariant" — false post-divergence), silently shipping the older factory; the overlay now ships only `env.js` + `bridge-client.js`. Build/release/sandbox/install scripts all repointed; the required sandbox gate's assertions rewritten to the new layout.
- **SX-804 (P4) — muscle + automation heat moved off `.md` frontmatter into `state.json`.** Every session used to rewrite muscle/automation `.md` files (heat bumped on load, decayed on idle) — constant churn in `.soma` checkpoints, and runtime state bleeding into source content files. Heat now lives in `state.json` (`muscles` / `automations` dicts, same shape as `protocols`), mutated in-memory during the session and persisted **once** at exhale (mirroring the protocol model). Frontmatter `heat:` becomes a static **seed** — read once to seed a muscle's first state entry, then never written. Selection is unchanged (live heat overlays each muscle before tiering); the transition is seamless (first boot seeds from the current frontmatter values). Kills the per-session `.md` churn; stale state entries are pruned on load.
- **SX-804 (P3) — tool config moved from `_tools.md` to `settings.json` `tools.disabled`, and is now authoritative.** Disabling a tool used to require a separate `.soma/body/_tools.md` file, and its gate only caught tools registered through `somaRegisterTool` — raw `pi.registerTool` tools (and the meta-tools) silently bypassed it. Now: (1) disable via `settings.json` → `tools: { disabled: ["name"] }` (unioned across the body chain); (2) the active set is filtered at session start (`pi.setActiveTools`), so the disable applies to **every** tool, not just soma-registered ones; (3) `_tools.md` is retired — its parser, the per-tool `## Overrides`, and the never-shipped `## Custom` markdown-tools (unused everywhere) are removed. Existing `_tools.md` files auto-migrate on next boot: disabled entries port to `settings.json`, the file is archived to `body/_archive/`. Hardwired tools (`delegate`) still can't be disabled. Simpler config, one home, actually works.

### Fixed
- **SX-804 (P2) — extension loader hygiene: `_`-prefixed files no longer auto-register dummy tools.** The seeded `~/.soma/extensions/_template.ts` example and the `_tool-template.ts` reference each registered a placeholder tool (`myTool`/`MyTool`) into every session's tool schema — cruft the model saw on every request. The soma extension injector now skips `_`-prefixed files (templates/partials aren't loadable extensions), and the canonical extension template moved from `extensions/_tool-template.ts` to `templates/extension-template.ts`, out of Pi's auto-load path. Smaller per-request tool schema, cleaner tool list.
- **SX-803 — Edit tool: fuzzy matches no longer silently flatten the whole file's typography, and "Could not find" now shows the actual bytes to copy.** Two fixes to the upstream Pi edit tool (vendored full-file override of `core/tools/edit-diff.js`, drift-guarded against the 0.79.6 fork base). (1) **Surgical fuzzy match:** when `oldText` differed from the file only by whitespace/quote/dash formatting, pristine Pi performed the replacement in *whole-file–normalized* space — silently rewriting every em-dash → hyphen, smart quote → straight, NBSP → space, and stripping every line's trailing whitespace, across the *entire file*, on a single fuzzy edit. Destructive for typography-heavy prose (blog posts, body files). The match is now mapped back to a byte span in the original content and only that span is spliced; all untouched bytes are preserved (verified by re-normalizing the chosen span — a non-round-tripping match falls through to a hint rather than a wrong write). (2) **Near-match hint:** a genuine miss now appends the actual nearby file lines (token-overlap located, typo-tolerant) so the model copies the exact bytes instead of reconstructing `oldText` from memory — the #1 cause of the error. Discovered and verified live (s01-4409c8); 16-case regression harness at `scripts/_dev/patches/edit-diff.test.mjs`.
- **SX-801 — `claude-cli` delegate children can build, not just read.** The `claude-cli/*` delegate backend (subscription-billed children via the official `claude` CLI) read tools from a `claude-cli-tools` frontmatter field that **no role declares** — every role declares `default-tools`. So every claude-cli child silently fell back to the read-only safe set (Read/Grep/Glob/WebSearch/WebFetch) and could never edit, write, or run bash, even for build roles. The backend now resolves tools from the role's declared `default-tools` (mapped soma→Claude tool names, default-deny on anything unmapped), with `claude-cli-tools` kept as an optional explicit override and read-only still the default when a role declares nothing. Roles declare their tools once; existing roles immediately gain write capability on the claude-cli path with no per-role edits. Also hardens the backend to scrub `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the child env (so `claude -p` always bills the subscription, never silent extra-usage) and returns an actionable "run `claude setup-token`" message on an expired-token 401 instead of an opaque error. (Reported by a sibling Soma instance.)
- **SX-800 — preload badge no longer lies green while the staleness warning fires.** The statusline showed `📝saved` (green) at the same moment soma-breathe warned "Preload now stale (N tool calls since save)". A user-turn reset zeroes the staleness counter and the statusline reconcile re-lands "saved", so a genuinely stale preload (work happened since it was written, file never rewritten) pinned green. The badge now derives staleness from ground truth — whether tool work post-dates the preload file's mtime — so it shows `📝stale` and agrees with the warning. Fresh preloads still show green; a real re-exhale clears it.
- **SX-799 — `/inhale` runtime-staleness guard.** `/inhale` resets the session via `newSession()` but stays in the same node process, so a process that booted before a mid-session runtime update replays stale in-memory modules — making an already-fixed crash appear to "recur." `/inhale` now detects a runtime updated after boot (module mtime vs process start) and blocks with a restart hint (`--force` to override) instead of running stale code.


## [0.35.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **coerce Opus oldText2/newText2 Edit mis-shape (SX-795)** — the Edit tool now folds a crammed second pair / strips empty leftovers in `prepareEditArguments` before validation, instead of rejecting the whole call. Clean input untouched.

### Changed
- **Body templates carry the "ground before think" discipline** — `soul.md` and `core_rules.md` lead with "Ground before think" / "Ground Before Reason" (reasoning interprets evidence, it doesn't stand in for it); `_memory.md` preload format adds the verified-vs-inherited check + orient-by-live-artifact guidance. Pristine `_memory.md` auto-updates on first boot; user-owned `soul.md`/`core_rules.md` ship to new installs only (never clobbered).
- **Delegation docs surface `headless` as the reliable mode (SX-794)** — `background-delegation.md` now documents all three modes (sync / headless / background) + a "which one?" guide.

### Fixed
- **error-sanitizer import injection prepends + fails loud (SX-793)** — fixes the `/inhale` TUI crash (`sanitizeApiError is not defined`) that shipped half-applied in v0.34.0.
- **build halts on a failed patch (SX-798)** — `build-dist.mjs` previously *swallowed* an `apply-patches.sh` failure (logged a ⚠, kept building) and could ship a half-patched dist. That is precisely how v0.34.0 shipped the crash. The build now refuses to continue when patching fails.


## [0.34.0] — 2026-06-18

<!-- Entries accumulate here and get promoted to a versioned section on release. -->

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **`soma:inbox.*` caps — mark inbox letters read/actioned/archived.** The markdown inbox (`.soma/inbox/*.md`) surfaces unread letters at boot, but the only way to clear one was hand-editing its `status:` frontmatter — high friction, so letters were read and never marked, and the boot summary piled up indefinitely. Four new caps mechanize it: `soma:inbox.list` (letters by status), `soma:inbox.read`, `soma:inbox.actioned`, `soma:inbox.archive` (move to `inbox/_archive/`). Each accepts a filename, slug, or unique partial; ambiguous refs list their candidates. Resolves the `.soma/` chain from cwd, so a letter in a parent inbox can be cleared from a child project. Free tier, no bridge. (SX-791)

### Fixed
- **Exhale crashed in an uninitialized directory.** `saveProtocolState` wrote `state.json` without ensuring `.soma/` existed, so running an exhale where the local `.soma/` was missing (e.g. a project that resolves state to a parent/grandparent soma) threw `ENOENT` and aborted the whole exhale. It now creates the directory first. Regression-tested.


## [0.33.1] — 2026-06-18

<!-- Entries accumulate here and get promoted to a versioned section on release. -->

### Changed
- **Pi runtime bumped 0.79.3 → 0.79.6.** All four `@earendil-works/pi-*` packages in lockstep. Patch-grade gap — bug fixes and opt-in features only, no API or behavior changes. Picks up a bash-tool settlement/draining fix (#5753) and SIGTERM signal-exit hardening (#5724). The `edit` tool is unchanged.
- **Dropped the `pi-tui-exit-cleanup` runtime patch** as redundant — Pi now restores the terminal on a crash natively (`InteractiveMode.uncaughtCrash` → `Terminal.stop()`), so the Soma-injected `process.on('exit')` handler is no longer needed. Terminal modes (bracketed-paste, Kitty keyboard, modifyOtherKeys, raw mode) are still restored on crash; the guarding test now verifies the native path.

### Fixed
- **`soma init` could fail on a clean production install** with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `semver` (and latently `ignore` / `yaml`). The bundled runtime imports these packages, but they were undeclared dependencies that only resolved via dev-only transitive hoisting; under `npm install --omit=dev` they vanished. They're now declared explicitly. (Caught by the pre-release sandbox during the Pi 0.79.6 bump.)


## [0.33.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **Per-model guard allowlist (`guard.trustedModels`).** When the active model matches a glob in the list (e.g. `["*sonnet*", "*opus*"]`), the `coreFiles` and `bashCommands` prompts relax to `"allow"` for that turn — capable models skip the nags while weaker models and new users keep full protection. Settable per-project or globally (child wins). Empty by default = no change.
- **Always-on irreversibility guards.** Destroying a `.soma` workspace or a `.git` history, running `git init`, destructive ops on the runtime install, and expensive operations (`npm publish`, `docker push`, …) now always require confirmation — they cannot be silenced by `bashCommands: "allow"` or a trusted model. Capability relaxes the routine prompts, never the catastrophic ones.
- **New documentation: Statusline & Notices** — the canonical reference for all three statusline lines, every indicator, and Soma's toast notices (including the preload lifecycle).

### Fixed
- **Preload "saved" double-notification.** A single preload write now shows exactly one confirmation (`✅ Preload written`) plus the statusline `📝saved` indicator, instead of a redundant second toast.
- **`guard.bashNotify` is now a real setting.** It was already in use but missing from the settings schema (so it was untyped and invisible); it's now documented and configurable (`"notify"` | `"off"`).
- **git-identity pre-commit hook silently blocked all commits** in any repo whose `settings.json` had no configured email (a `pipefail` crash). Commits work again with no email set.
- **Core-file guard now also covers `edit`.** Previously only `write` was gated, so a model could `edit` a runtime file or `settings.json` with no prompt. Editing them is now gated like writing (ordinary body files like `soul.md` remain free to edit).


## [0.32.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **consolidate map to v0.28.1-to-v0.32.0 (close the chain gap, SX-785)**
- **archive-match protection in template-auto-update sentinel (SX-789)**
- **gap-safe --fix actually migrates behind workspaces (SX-789)**
- **npm-lag is SOFT for independent trains, not HARD (s01-542b99)**


## [0.32.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **v0.31.2→v0.32.0 phase + sentinels + template archive (SX-785)**
- **credential-file tree-scan in channel guard (s01-542b99)**
- **fail-fast migration gate (phase 0.6) + halt-before-slow-phases (SX-785)**
- **add 'The Through-Line' to the preload template (cross-soma convergence)**
- **surface the children pattern + claude-cli in delegate help (SX-784)**
- **claude-cli backend + 'soma claude' — headless sub-agents via the official Claude CLI (SX-782)**
- **SOMA_SYSTEM_CORE A/B override for prompt split-testing (SX-779)**
- **teach the meta-tool arg-discovery reflex (SX-778)**

### Fixed
- **persist preload-saved notice + always surface runtime branch (SX-783)**
- **guard keepalive timer against session-replacement stale ctx (SX-781)**
- **system-core.md was silently dropped from every prompt (SX-780)**
- **post-ship narrative reconcile that doesn't depend on HEAD (SX-777)**


## [0.31.2] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **SX-776 — `soma model --list` (and bare `soma model`) showed 0 models.** Resource-path injection (the `--extension`/`--skill`/… flags Soma appends for Pi's loader) leaked into utility-subcommand argument parsing, so `model` read an injected extension path as its search term → "0 models matching …/_template.ts". Utility subcommands now parse a clean copy of your args; Pi sessions still receive the full set (extension loading unaffected).
- **SX-736 — statusline `/reload` worktree-mismatch label.** When an extension/core edit lands in a different worktree than the runtime actually loads from (e.g. editing a dev checkout while the runtime runs its own copy), the statusline now shows `⚠ sync dev + /reload` instead of a plain `🔄 /reload` that wouldn't pick up the change. Detection is topology-independent — it compares the edited path against the running code's own `import.meta.url`, so end users (whose runtime is their only worktree) never see it.


## [0.31.1] — 2026-06-14

### Changed
- **Pi runtime bumped 0.79.1 → 0.79.3** (all 4 `@earendil-works/pi-*` in lockstep). Inherits upstream bug fixes: Codex context-window billing-hazard fix, GPT-5 metadata corrections, Anthropic refusal `stop_details` preserved in error messages, Claude Fable 5 thinking-off payload fix (#5567), project-trust detection fix (#5619), model-resolution / `/fork` / `/share` / loose-list fixes, and ignored late tool-progress updates. Soma patches re-derived against the new upstream shapes (agent-loop tool-result wrap, OpenRouter `session_id` body param); the `httpIdleTimeoutMs` patch was **dropped** — upstream now ships it natively for all providers.

### Fixed
- **SX-771/SX-736 — runtime-aware indicator, ungated + smart-show**
- **SX-774 — sync dev now syncs source extensions/ (the loaded path)**
- **SX-773 — path resolver broke from inside repos/agent**
- **SX-770 — dev(op='list') showed 0 caps (untiered families)**
- **ship Step 5 npm-publish detection excludes the just-created tag (was always skipping)**


## [0.31.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **Pi runtime 0.79.1 — native Claude Fable 5.** Bumped the Pi runtime (all four `@earendil-works/pi-*` packages, in lockstep) from 0.78.0 → 0.79.1. Fable 5's model definition (1M context, vision, `xhigh` adaptive thinking, $10/$50 per M) now ships natively in Pi's model registry — Soma no longer needs a local `models.json` stopgap to describe it, so a fresh install gets Fable with correct cost metadata out of the box. (s01-781277)
- **Meta-workflow cadence — now a core protocol, with guided adoption.** The operating cadence (three nested loops — BREATH → ARC → EVOLUTION; a self-amending Observation Ledger; a Decision Register) ships as the `meta-workflow` protocol (v1.1.0) alongside `breath-cycle` v3.0.0 (self-initiated rotation; the exhale is a complete checklist, preload last). Installing the protocol delivers the *shape*; a new adoption checklist + inline starter `META_WORKFLOW.md` skeleton turn it on per-project (just ask Soma *"set up the meta-workflow cadence"*). New `docs/meta-workflow.md` (Setup & Overview) + a how-it-works section. The protocol declares `requires: breath-cycle` so minimal installs self-heal the eager-trigger dependency. (s01-5d6a30)
- **`soma doctor` advisory: meta-workflow protocol present but no instance.** `doctor`/`status`/`health` now nudge when the cadence protocol is installed but the project has no `META_WORKFLOW.md` instance (it's inert until instantiated), pointing at `docs/meta-workflow.md`. Advisory only — not a warning/issue; checks the three real-world instance locations (`.soma/` root, `cycles/`, `releases/`) so it never false-positives; no-ops outside a project. (s01-5d6a30)
- **Claude Fable 5 model support.** Fable 5 (Anthropic's Mythos-class model — 1M context, vision, `xhigh` adaptive thinking, $10/$50 per M) is now first-class: `MODEL_ALIASES` (`fable` / `fable-5` → `claude-fable-5`), premium classification in `inferClass`, the model definition in `~/.soma/agent/models.json` (the installed pi-ai 0.78.0 didn't define it — it was resolving metadata-blind with no cost tracking), `enabledModels` (Ctrl+P selectable), and a `*fable*` breathe-threshold block. Refreshed the stale `opus`/`sonnet` aliases to current ids (`-4-8` / `-4-6`) while there. (s01-81f576)

### Fixed
- **Soma transparently trusts its own projects under Pi 0.79's project-trust gating.** Pi 0.79 added a trust gate around project-local config (`.soma/settings.json`, project extensions) — and non-interactive runs (delegate, `soma -p`) would silently resolve *untrusted* and drop your per-project settings. Soma now auto-trusts any genuine Soma project (one with a `.soma/body/`) via a `project_trust` handler, so your project config always loads with no prompt; non-Soma directories still follow Pi's normal trust flow. (s01-781277)
- **Fresh installs reliably resolve every runtime dependency.** The compiled runtime imports several packages directly (`undici`, `chalk`, `execa`, `pi-agent-core`) that the runtime package previously left to transitive resolution — under some npm install strategies (nested rather than hoisted) this surfaced as `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at boot. The runtime package now declares its full dependency set explicitly. (s01-781277)
- **Statusline preload indicator no longer sticks on "stale" after a fresh write.** The consolidated lifecycle's transition map (Cycle 29) only allowed `requested→saved`, so the deterministic preload-write detector was silently dropped whenever state was `stale` or `unrequested` — re-writing a stale preload left the statusline showing `📝stale` despite the fresh save. Added `stale→saved` + `unrequested→saved` (a file write is ground truth). The statusline now reads the lifecycle *state* for the indicator rather than `existsSync(file) + a raw counter`, so a prior session's preload file no longer shows a false green `📝saved` at a fresh boot. (s01-5d6a30)
- **Keepalive no longer closes the TUI before the auto-exhale preload lands.** On keepalive exhaustion the auto-exhale only *sends a message* asking the agent to write a preload (async, multi-turn), but `checkIdleShutdown` would `process.exit` gated only on `isAgentBusy` — and since the user had been idle long enough to exhaust keepalive, the exit fired between turns before the write completed. The post-exhale shutdown now waits while the lifecycle is `requested`; the 30-minute absolute-idle backstop still prevents zombie sessions. (s01-5d6a30)
- **Delegate sync path repaired — `pi-agent-core.Agent class not found`.** The sync delegate used a dynamic `import("@earendil-works/pi-agent-core")`, which bypasses Pi's jiti alias map (only *static* imports are rewritten) and resolved to the installed top-level package (new `AgentSession` API, no `Agent`) instead of Pi's bundled copy (which still exports `class Agent`). Switched to a static import. Prevention: any `@earendil-works/pi-*` import in jiti-loaded extension code must be static top-level. (s01-81f576)
- **Delegate honors the role's `default-model` in background spawn + shows the real model.** `spawnBackground()` hardcoded `?? "claude-haiku-4-5"` and never consulted the role's frontmatter, so `delegate({role:X})` ignored the role's model. Resolution is now `explicit model > role default-model > haiku fallback` (new `resolveRoleDefaultModel`). Also fixed the `model: "auto"` display bug (the spawn record + `soma:agent.list` now show the actually-booted model). (s01-81f576)
- **Shell-injection hardening (3 surfaces).** A security audit found a systemic `execSync`-with-string-interpolation pattern; all converted to `execFileSync(cmd, [args])` (array args, no shell): `/hub share` (`name` + a file-derived frontmatter `description` flowed into `gh`/`git` shell strings — a malicious description in a cloned/hub `.soma` could run arbitrary shell on an innocent share), drop-in slash-commands (unquoted `restArgs`), and scan-logs (`toolArgs`/cwd). Behavior preserved for valid input. (Still open — folds into the Pi 0.79.1 / project-trust work: project-local `.soma` scripts execute with no trust gate.) (s01-81f576)
- **Image paste into the TUI works — `@mariozechner/clipboard` is now a direct dependency.** Same bug class as the photon image-reads fix: soma bundles the engine's clipboard reader (`dist/utils/clipboard-native.js`) which loads the native `@mariozechner/clipboard` by bare specifier, but it was only a transitive dep — so soma's top-level copy resolved it to `null` and image paste (Ctrl+V) silently read an empty clipboard, *regardless of keybinding*. Declaring it directly (pinned 0.3.9) forces hoisting. Note: on macOS, terminals can't receive image data via Cmd+V — use **Ctrl+V**, which makes the app read the OS clipboard. (s01-cfe9ac)
- **`soma-release-ship.sh`: push dev to meetsoma before the main-sync (SX-768).** Recurring ship bug (bit v0.30.0 + v0.30.1): the release/bump commit was made locally but never pushed before the dev→main sync fetched `meetsoma/dev`, so the sync merged stale dev (missing the bump) and the runtime landed a version behind. New Step 3.5 pushes dev first and aborts loudly on failure. (s01-cfe9ac)


## [0.30.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Image reads no longer silently break — `@silvia-odwyer/photon-node` is now a direct dependency.** Soma bundles the engine's image code (resize via photon WASM), which imports photon by bare specifier. Photon was only a *transitive* dep, so when npm nested it instead of hoisting, image reads died with a misleading "could not be resized below size limit" note — regardless of actual size. Declaring it directly (pinned 0.3.4) forces top-level hoisting; `soma update` runs npm install on pull, so installs self-heal. (s01-cfe9ac, reported by a sibling soma)
- **Release-prepare gate: Phase 1 split into unit vs release-state tests (SX-765).** The gate ran the full suite as one blunt hard-block, but tests validating *release state* (installed-runtime version, dev↔main parity, npm registry) can't pass before ship — so they false-blocked releases whose code was sound. Tests now opt into release-state handling with a `# @release-state` marker; pre-ship failures route to NEEDS-REVIEW (re-checked in their dedicated phases + post-ship), while unit failures still hard-gate. (s01-cfe9ac)


## [0.30.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **Headless delegation — `soma:agent.delegate {headless:true}`** — a minimal-inference delegation path that spawns `soma -p` as a subprocess (not a tmux TUI), captures structured output, and detects completion via exit code (fixing the flaky pane-tail completion of background mode). Routes to OpenCode **free** models (`big-pickle` → `deepseek-v4-flash-free`), off the Claude subscription extra-usage wall, with auto-retry + model fallback on rate-limit. Role system prompts inject via `--append-system-prompt`. `runHeadless`/`loadRole`/`stripPreamble` in `extensions/soma-delegate.ts`. Patterns adapted from upstream pi-mono's subagent example. (v0.30.0 Phase 1, s01-3a1d9b)
- **Chain delegation — `soma:agent.delegate {chain:[{role,task,model?},...]}`** — sequential headless steps where `{previous}` is substituted with the prior step's output (scout→planner→worker style). Each step gets the same retry+fallback. (v0.30.0 Phase 2)
- **`soma-dev cycle`** — the test-before-main dev→release flow: curate CHANGELOG (headless, free) → commit → build dev dist → **smoke the dev build before main** → gate → hand off to the release orchestrator. Main only ever receives tested-good code. Only the changelog + smoke steps use a model (both free); the rest is bash. (v0.30.0 Phase 3)
- **`soma-series-rollover.sh`** — scaffolds `releases/vX.Y.x/INDEX.md` + sweeps current-series markers on a minor bump, closing the orphaned-step drift the version-truth gate flags but couldn't fix. (s01-3a1d9b)

### Changed
- **npm and agent are independent version trains (supersedes SX-659 collapsed train)** — the npm thin-CLI is a one-time bootstrap; `soma update` pulls the agent runtime via `git pull` from soma-beta and never re-fetches npm, so publishing npm on an agent-only release delivers users nothing. npm now publishes **only when the thin-CLI code changes** (`ship.sh` Step 5 is conditional on `npm/thin-cli.js`/`npm/lib/` diffs); when it does publish, the version syncs to the agent's so `soma --version` stays legible (it shows both, labeled). The version-drift gates (`test-doctor`, `test-release-completeness`) now treat npm *lagging* the agent as the expected steady state. This is what RELEASE-FLOW.md + body/soma-cli.md already documented; the collapsed-train enforcement was the stale half. (s01-cfe9ac)
- **RELEASE-FLOW.md rewired to two modes** (orchestrated / manual) — Step 7 now calls the gated `soma-release-prepare.sh` orchestrator instead of bypassing it; the doc describes decisions, the scripts own mechanics (stops the doc↔script drift). phase-5-release.md slimmed 390→169 lines (history lifted to `release-lessons.md`). (s01-3a1d9b)

### Fixed
- **`soma --help` shows Soma's commands when a project has extensions** — `--help` delegates to the runtime cli.js via `delegateToCore()`, which prepends project `-e <ext>` flags before the command. cli.js checked `args[0] === "--help"`, so with extensions present --help fell through to Pi's native help instead of Soma's command list. Fixed by skipping leading `-e`/`--extension` pairs to find the effective command (subcommand help like `soma focus --help` stays intact). Manifested with a project `.soma/extensions` dir (dogfood + power users). (s01-cfe9ac)
- **release-prepare crash: `PREP_VERSION` unbound in Phase 5.5** — the website-readiness phase referenced `$PREP_VERSION` at a `[[ -z ]]` check but only assigned it inside the `PROPOSAL_FILE` conditional; with `set -u`, the common unset-PROPOSAL_FILE path crashed the whole prepare run at the tone-check. Initialized before the block. (Completes the partial fix `a7ba618c` made on main.) (s01-cfe9ac)
- **universal timeout for all providers (upstream 7c531d05)**
- **`soma:body.audit` no longer false-flags compiler-prepended slots** — the audit told users to "move `muscle_digests` after `<rules>`," but that slot is prepended by `compileFrontalCortex` (not template-interpolated, gate-locked) and `essential: true` (removing it breaks muscle loading). The advice could have moved a load-bearing slot. Check 3 now skips prepended slots (`muscle_digests`/`protocol_summaries`/`scripts_table`) and the audit gained a "Slot mechanics" footer that points at `body/DNA.md` (the canonical explanation) rather than duplicating it. (s01-3a1d9b)

### Internal
- Test-suite hygiene (s01-cfe9ac): `test-keepalive` asserted a refactored-out `bonus10` literal → now checks the `_getTier()` mechanism; `test-meta-hygiene` required an inline `Results:` echo → now also recognizes the shared `_shared.sh` `results` helper (227/227); removed a stray gitignored empty `.soma/amps/muscles/` dir that false-tripped `test-muscles`.
- Headless-delegation polish: `delegate` help text documents the `headless`/`chain` modes; new `tests/test-delegate-headless.sh` unit-tests `loadRole` + `stripPreamble` (non-flaky, no model call). (v0.30.0 Phase 4)

### Pending (not yet shipped)
- **Browser Ship 2** — end-to-end smoke across CDP ports (needs bridge running).


## [0.29.1] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **`/body update` CLI command** — version-aware template comparison and update workflow. Subcommand on `/body`, reads `prompts/body-update.md` and sends as followUp. Agent walks user through classified comparison (current/updateable/customized/legacy/extra), respects `customized: true` flag, creates backups before overwriting. (5d1a965b, s01-34d9de)
- **Doctor `/body update` suggestion** — both "current" and "migration needed" paths now suggest `/body update` when stale or missing templates are detected. Bridges the gap between structural migrations (doctor) and content evolution (`/body update`). (f092e239, s01-34d9de)

### Fixed
- **`/exhale <note>` now processed in all paths** — note extracted before early-return check so it works when preload already exists (new, update-existing, already-saved). Note format upgraded to `⚠️ USER NOTE` with action hint. (a241d635, b788848e, s01-8f2308)
- **Statusline preload detection simplified** — checks preload file directly on disk instead of depending on `breatheDetail.preloadWritten` lifecycle state. (a241d635, s01-8f2308)
- **Preload validator no longer warns about missing "Next Session"** — renamed to "Start Here" in required + recommended section checks. Recommended sections updated to match current template (Who You Were, Gaps, Unfinished, Traps, Patterns). (s01-8f2308)

### Changed
- **Exhale note visibility** — `### Note` → `⚠️ USER NOTE` with scope/directive hint. Template `_memory.md` and docs (`commands.md`, `getting-started.md`) updated. (a241d635, b788848e, s01-8f2308)
- **Preload template fallback synced with `_memory.md`** — hardcoded fallback in `core/preload.ts` now matches canonical format. (f73d75e9, s01-8f2308)

## [0.29.0] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **poll preload file on disk to detect manual exhale writes (s01-e56328)**
- **muscle_digests slot estimate now capped by configured tokenBudget (s01-e56328)**
- **system-core.md now ships from correct source + adds structure-aware tools guidance** — build was copying from wrong path, runtime couldn't find it. Now ships from `repos/agent/prompts/` to `dist/prompts/`. Added "Structure-aware before raw" reflex: `soma:code.map`, `.find`, `.outline`, `soma:seam.trace` listed as first-reach tools. (ebdd6306)

### Improved
- **Website docs synced for 21 caps** — tools.md (20→21), cli-tools.md (17→21), browser-setup.md (new caps in matrix, cap-based quick start, bridge note), pro-tools.md (updated browser entry).
- **Roadmap browser-tools.svg** — DOM scanning + click/fill/wait visualization for the browser automation story.

### Infrastructure
- **Bridge CDP endpoints committed** — `cdp.ts` click() via Input.dispatchMouseEvent (bypasses React Aria isTrusted), fill() with value injection + events, waitForElement() with polling. `bridge.ts` POST /api/browser/xray, /click, /fill, /wait endpoints. (somaverse 7093f62)

## [0.28.4] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **gap-safe settings backfill + template auto-update (v0.28.1)** — three sentinel-gated migrations run at every boot regardless of migration chain gaps: settings keys backfill, template auto-update, exhale-note template header update.
- **v0.28.0 → v0.28.1 migration phase file** — exhale note + template drift + inhale model fix documented with gap-safe sentinel pattern.
- **`/exhale note` header redesign** — `### User's Note for Next Session` renamed to `### Note`, dual-purpose: scopes the current wrap AND passes directives forward. Template (`_memory.md`) and docs updated.

### Fixed
- **Theme crash on `/inhale --model`** — `"warm"`, `"gitCyan"`, `"gitYellow"`, `"gitBlue"` weren't in Pi's `ThemeColor` union, causing TUI render crash. Replaced with valid union members: `"muted"`, `"warning"`, `"accent"`. (47a0de5f, s01-72adde)
- **`PROPOSAL_FILE` unbound variable in release prepare Phase 5.5** — `set -euo pipefail` halted the script before Phase 6 created the proposal file.

## [0.28.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **`soma inhale --model <model>` now loads the preload instead of treating the model name as a preload target** — the CLI's `nameArg` extraction stole model values (e.g. `opencode/big-pickle`) as preload names, setting `SOMA_INHALE_TARGET` and failing `findPreloadByName`. PassThrough values are now excluded from nameArg extraction. (s01-14580a)
- **Full preload format at all context thresholds — minimal format loses context** — high-context preloads now use the full structured template with Resume Point, What Shipped, and In-Flight sections. (1ae67a38)
- **`/exhale <note>` directs the current agent during preload writing.** Text after `/exhale` is injected as a `### Note` block in the EXHALE follow-up. The agent uses it to scope the wrap ("quick" → skip body audit + MLR) AND to pass directives forward to the next session's Start Here. `--note` prefix and quotes stripped. `/exhale` alone works the same. (89efd1b6, s01-65fd1e)
- **ANSI colors replaced with `theme.fg()` calls** — header and statusline in the TUI now respect Pi's theme system instead of hardcoded escape codes across 33 points. (5a824c6c, s01-6a544e)
- **Release Step 6 delegates to `soma-dev sync main`** — replaces inline push+branch logic with the dedicated command. (256e968d)
- **Release Step 6 main-sync is now a HARD gate** — `⚠ push failed` no longer lets the release continue; exits 1 if main-sync fails, preventing v0.28.0-style stale-runtime-after-ship. (3c51de02, s01-5c0055)

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **`soma-dev sync main` as a proper command** — release Step 6 extracted from inline bash into a proper `soma-dev sync main` command that handles CI-drift detection, rebase + merge, conflict resolution, dist rebuild, and version verification. (4d53663c)


## [0.28.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **All models from Together AI, OpenCode Go, Gemini 3.x** — Pi 0.74+ unlocked new providers and model families. Together AI inference, Google Gemini 3.x support, OpenCode Go models — all available without configuration.
- **Claude Opus 4.8 support** — Pi 0.77+ supports Anthropic's latest model.
- **842+ models total** — Pi 0.78 resolver sees everything the ecosystem offers.
- **roadmap tone-check as hard gate** in release prepare script Phase 5.5.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime upgraded 5 versions** — `@mariozechner/*@0.73.1` → `@earendil-works/*@0.78.0`. Full namespace migration across all four Pi packages, 61 source files swept, 8 patches audited against new compiled shapes. (3414a84)
- **Two patches retired** — title-symbol (Pi now reads `piConfig.name` → APP_TITLE dynamically) and compaction.js estimateTokens guard (upstream refactored to guard internally). One patch rewritten for 0.78.0 API (pi-tui image height cap).

### Fixed
- **`soma model <p> set` now actually works** — `enabledModels[0]` always unshifts to front. Pi's model resolver picks `scopedModels[0]` before `defaultModel`, so in-place updates never took effect. Months-old bug.
- **`soma model <p> project` support** — project-local defaults via `.soma/settings.json`. Four options: global, project-only, global+start, cancel.
- **`soma inhale --model <p>` flag forwarding** — inhale now extracts `--model`, `--provider`, `--thinking-level`, and `--models` flags and passes them through to Pi. Previously all three inhale paths called `main([])`, silently dropping flags.
- **Stale project `defaultModel` removed** — `claude-opus-4-7` was silently overriding global via deep-merge, producing nonexistent `openrouter/claude-opus-4-7`.
- **13 transitive deps restored** — `npm uninstall` dropped undici, chalk, minimatch, diff, glob, highlight.js, hosted-git-info, jiti, typebox, cross-spawn, execa, proper-lockfile.
- **Test suite hardened for migration** — 3 stale grep patterns updated, resetBreatheState now resets preloadNotifyState, seam/trace and compaction tests fixed for 0.78.0.


## [0.27.6] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **shared preload lifecycle state machine** — `_shared/preload-lifecycle.ts` module unifies preload tracking across breathe, boot, and statusline extensions. Single source of truth replaces 7 independent `let` flags. (Cycle 29)
- **route capabilities for lifecycle access** — `preload:lifecycle` (read state), `preload:transition` (write transitions), `preload:reset` (fresh session), `preload:noteToolCall` (track work after save). (Cycle 29)
- **three-state auto-breath config** — `breathe.auto` now accepts `"on"` (proactive), `"auto"` (adaptive), `"off"` (passive). Backward-compat with boolean and `"global"` values. (Cycle 28)
- **sandbox `--dummy` mode** — simulated API responses, no API key needed. Runs all 10 API-dependent tests offline. (Cycle 28)
- **sandbox `--brief` mode** — compact dot-progress output, details on failures only. Clean CI logs.
- **wire kanban search/related/similar caps — Cycle 27**
- **dev-sync dist provenance indicator** — `.dev-synced` marker written by `soma-dev sync dev`; statusline shows `(main +dev)` when running dev-synced dist on main branch. Marker cleared by `soma-dev switch main/rollback`.
- **tiered progressive-disclosure format for soma(op='list')**

### Fixed
- **85% safety net no longer overrides manual `/exhale` or keepalive auto-exhale** — safety net checks shared lifecycle state before acting. If preload is already `REQUESTED` (by `/exhale` or keepalive), it notifies instead of initiating a competing breathe or rotating immediately. (Cycle 29)
- **`/exhale` at high context no longer triggers immediate rotation without preload update** — exhaleHandler calls `preloadLifecycle.transition("requested", { source: "manual" })` before the followUp, so the safety net sees state=`REQUESTED` and waits for the preload write. Stale-preload immediate rotation case fixed. (Cycle 29)
- **keepalive auto-exhale no longer double-requests preload** — gated on lifecycle state: skips if already `REQUESTED` or `SAVED`. (Cycle 29)
- **preload now loads after auto-rotate** — `.rotate-signal` was cleaned at extension load before `session_start` could read it. Deferred cleanup to startup handler, which detects rotation and injects preload. (Cycle 28)
- **sandbox help text test** — `rc --help` triggered Pi model resolution, polluting stdout. Changed to `thin-cli.js --help` which bypasses Pi init. (Cycle 28 carry)
- **sandbox license header test in `--main` mode** — source worktree lacks release-injected headers; skip like `--local` mode. Updated checked path to `dist/extensions/` for shipped builds.
- **sandbox `--dev` timeout** — `soma-release.sh --dry-run` ran `npm test` (55 scripts × 2 passes). Added `SKIP_TESTS=1` to release dry-run in dev sandbox mode.
- **restore protocol paths after repos/agent/.soma/ skeleton removal**

### Test
- **rotate-signal continuity** — 14 assertions verifying `.rotate-signal` not cleared at extension load, read at session_start, cleaned after consumption. (Cycle 28)
- **tri-state string value normalization** — 4 tests for `"on"`, `"auto"`, `"global"` legacy compat, `default` fallback.




## [0.27.5] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **ancestor .soma/ walk-up + example extensions seeding + inherit gating**
- **SX-763 — OpenRouter session_id in request body**

### Fixed
- **scan and load extension files instead of directory path for --extension flag**
- **show model.name instead of model.id + Free for $0 cost models**
- **strip injected resource paths from inhale nameArg extraction**
- **revert models.generated.js patch — use models.json instead**
- **obfuscation coverage tightened — addons + _shared correctly scoped**
- **obfuscation pipeline hardened — blanket coverage for core, extensions, addons, _shared**
- **--skip-tests flag for soma-release.sh, wired into ship script**

### Removed
- **stale repos/agent/.soma/ directory — dead skeleton, gitignore blanket**



## [0.27.4] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **SX-762 — argv.push instead of splice(2,0) for user-global paths**
- **repair doctor --help assertions + github runtime test script path**
- **SX-762 — defense-in-depth: env override + existence guard + build gate**
- **SX-762 — call soma-code.sh directly via execFile, not 'soma code' CLI**
- **bump obfuscator string-array-threshold 0.8→1.0**
- **harden blacklist — dual-signal + obfuscation pipeline**
- **harden blacklist — dual-signal + obfuscation pipeline**




## [0.27.3] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.

- **`soma:seam.*` addon family — concept archaeology caps** (s01-345201, SX-744). Eight new caps + 2 docs caps wire the existing shell archaeology tools into the cap surface so the agent reaches for them under context pressure. `soma:seam.trace` (free tier — wraps `amps/scripts/soma-trace.sh`), `soma:seam.ancestors` (PRO — vault agents + Pi/Claude sessions w/ attribution), `soma:seam.timeline` (PRO — chronological evolution), `soma:seam.sessions` (dev tree — search `.soma/memory/sessions/` + Pi JSONLs), `soma:seam.seeds` (PRO), `soma:seam.gaps` (PRO — orphan docs), `soma:seam.web` (PRO — **persistent** markdown trace written to `.soma/memory/webs/`), `soma:seam.stats` (dev tree — Pi JSONL analytics). Plus `soma:docs.related` + `soma:docs.impact` (dev tree — frontmatter graph walk). Caps degrade gracefully when underlying scripts aren't present (PRO/dev message). Honors Recall's "mind of the place" lineage. New file `extensions/_shared/script-resolver.ts` extracts the shared shell-out + path-resolution helper. Closure test (passing): `soma:seam.ancestors "breathe"` returns `Zenith (openclaw-dev) — dev lead, vault refactorer, soma's daddy`. 10/10 smoke tests green in `tests/test-seam-caps.sh`. Plan: `.soma/releases/v0.27.x/plans/seam-addon-family.md`.

### Fixed
- **exclude tincture/_generated from path scan**

## [0.27.2](https://github.com/meetsoma/soma-agent/compare/v0.27.1...v0.27.2) (2026-05-10)


### Features

* **meta-tools:** family-summary view for op='list' (action-oriented cheat sheet) ([8a0aee0](https://github.com/meetsoma/soma-agent/commit/8a0aee0de77a204d41875d999f63a0902324f867))


### Documentation

* catch up whats-new + skills_block transplant + auto-breathe variants + delegate cycle workflow ([88afed8](https://github.com/meetsoma/soma-agent/commit/88afed8853d74c51dd7a14d00aceff71e9721a6d))



## [0.27.1](https://github.com/meetsoma/soma-agent/compare/v0.27.0...v0.27.1) (2026-05-10)

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.

- **Model-aware breathe thresholds** (cycle 16, s01-7b287c). New tri-state `breathe.auto`: `"off"` / `"global"` / `"model-aware"` (boolean still parsed for back-compat via migration `breathe-tri-state-v0.27.0`). New `breathe.thresholds` map with glob patterns (e.g. `"*sonnet*"`) selects per-model `warnRange`/`exhaleRange` percentages from `ctx.model.id`. Sonnet's empirical `extra usage required for long context` wall (~48% on default-tier accounts) now triggers warn at 28-33% and auto-exhale at 34-50% — well before the wall, instead of the old fixed 50/70 thresholds that fired AFTER the wall hit. Opus uses 60-74 / 75-90; default fallback uses 50-64 / 65-85. Default install ships `auto: "model-aware"`. `/auto-breathe` accepts `off|global|model-aware|status` subcommands. 76 tests pass (was 47/55 before, +21 new tests for tri-state + per-model resolution + migration). Closes the wall-before-threshold bug that crashed s01-8b3cb3 mid-pipeline.
- **`soma-dev delegate cycle <brief>` workflow** (cycle 17, s01-7b287c). Full implementation pipeline for any markdown brief (cycle.md, inbox/*.md, plans/*.md). Composes `intern` (investigate, 80-call budget) → `intern` (build, 80-call budget) → `verifier` (test, 25 calls) → `pr_author` (description, 30 calls). Total ~215 tool calls / ~$2.50 per cycle. Outputs `/tmp/soma-cycle-investigation.md`, `/tmp/soma-cycle-impl-summary.md`, `/tmp/soma-pr-description.md`. Flags: `--no-pr`, `--no-verify`. Built because single `builder` (25-call budget) was too small for multi-step cycles like cycle 16 (9 steps, ~80+ tool calls).

### Fixed

- **`/inhale` no longer double-injects preload after rotation** (cycle 17 bug #1, s01-7b287c). Empirically verified across 10 sessions in the last 14 days: every `/inhale`-triggered rotation produced TWO preload-injection messages in the new session — one from soma-boot's `session_start` "new" branch (`[Soma Boot — rotated session]`, ~16K chars), one from `/inhale`'s post-await `send()` (`[Soma Inhale — Loading Preload]`, ~16K chars). ~8K tokens duplicated per `/inhale`. Fix: soma-boot now exposes `route.provide("preload:wasInjected", ...)`; `/inhale` queries this after `await ctx.newSession({})` and skips its own send if `session_start` already injected. Print-mode safety preserved (when `ctx.hasUI=false` the session_start branch skips, flag stays false, `/inhale` falls back to direct send).
- **`/inhale` catch-fallback race** (cycle 17 bug #2, s01-7b287c). The catch block at `soma-boot.ts:3007-3020` previously fired its fallback preload-send unconditionally on any `newSession()` throw. If the throw came AFTER `session_start` had emitted (e.g. `apply()` / `setup()` / `finishSessionReplacement()` failure post-runtime-creation), the fallback would TRIPLE-stack with both the session_start injector and the happy-path injector. Same `preload:wasInjected` flag now discriminates: catch only sends if session_start hadn't already.
- **`session_start` "new" branch fallback when boot template missing** (cycle 17, s01-7b287c). Previously, if `loadBootMessage()` returned null (boot template not found), the rotation message was silently skipped — the new session had no preload injection, and `/inhale`'s old post-await send was the only thing carrying it. After bug #1 fix, that path no longer exists, so session_start now falls back to a minimal `## Preload (from last session)\n\n${preload.content}` message when the template is missing.
- **Honest auto-breathe notification text** (cycle 17 bug #3, s01-7b287c). The `🪵 Auto-breathe: rotating at N%` notification fired when the threshold was hit, but actual rotation only happens later in `turn_end` after the agent writes the preload (within `graceSeconds`, default 30s). New text: `🪵 Preload requested at N% — rotating after agent writes it`. The other branch (preload-already-written, immediate `.rotate-signal`) keeps its honest "Rotating — preload already written" text.

### Documentation

- **Auto-rotation Path A vs Path B clarification** (cycle 17 bug #5 audit, s01-7b287c). Per Pi types (`pi-coding-agent/dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts`), `newSession` lives on `ExtensionCommandContext`, not on the base `ExtensionContext` event handlers receive. Auto-breathe's `performRotation` falling back to `.rotate-signal` + process re-exec (Path A) is correct by design — Pi treats process re-exec as the safer auto-rotation route. In-process `route.get("session:new")` (Path B) is a happy-path optimization available only after a user has invoked `/breathe`/`/inhale`/`/auto-breathe` in the current session. Comment block added to `soma-breathe.ts:performRotation` documenting this; notify text changed to `🪵 Rotating session (process re-exec)...`.


## [0.27.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.

- **Pi upstream monitor — live version gap in every session** (s01-8b3cb3). GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/upstream-monitor.yml`) watches `badlogic/pi-mono` (source of `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) every 6 hours. Writes `PI_UPSTREAM.md` to the agent root with: current pinned version, latest npm version, releases behind count, and flagged commits relevant to Soma (covers all 33 Pi API usages: `registerTool`, `registerCommand`, `sendUserMessage`, 11 event hooks, 7 patch targets). New `{{pi_gap}}` body var in `resolveBlockVariables` reads `PI_UPSTREAM.md` at session start and injects live gap into the system prompt. `soma-dev status` surfaces flagged ⚠️ items in yellow. Eliminates manually tracking Pi version drift.

- **Autonomous CI loop — nightly tests + issue filing + fix pipeline** (s01-8b3cb3, smoke-validated s01-ae942e). Three-layer self-healing CI: (1) `.github/workflows/test-nightly.yml` runs 25 portable tests on schedule (4am UTC) and on push to dev/main; on failure, auto-files a structured GitHub issue tagged `nightly-failure` with failing tests, error excerpts, Pi version, last 5 commits, and a fix brief for the next agent. Dedupe gate skips filing when an open issue already exists for the same failure. (2) `dev:issue.create` + `dev:issue.list` addon caps for agent-filed issues from within sessions. (3) `soma-dev delegate ci-fix <url>` orchestrates: `issue_investigator` → `builder` → `verifier`. 18 tests gained `CI=true` skip guards (workspace/dist-dependent tests self-skip). `pr-check.yml` hardened: tsc typecheck job + changelog blocking + conventional-commit format validation. End-to-end smoke s01-ae942e drove a deliberate test failure through nightly→issue→dedupe→revert→green.

- **Autonomous PR workflow — `soma-dev delegate pr`** (s01-8b3cb3). Full pipeline from commits to complete PR: `soma-pr-brief.sh` generates structured brief (git-cliff CHANGELOG, affected files, semver bump type, docs to update, roadmap entry suggestion); `changelog_curator` writes rich `[Unreleased]` narrative; `pr_author` writes PR description; `doc_writer` updates flagged docs; `verifier` confirms tests pass. `cliff.toml` added — git-cliff configured for Keep-A-Changelog format from conventional commits (feat→Added, fix→Fixed, ci/chore/test filtered). `release-please` manifest updated from stale 0.22.1 → 0.26.2; auto-trigger enabled on push to dev.

- **`soma-dev delegate` — multi-agent workflow orchestrator** (s01-8b3cb3). New command composes child agents into named end-to-end pipelines: `pr` / `pr-brief` / `ci-fix <url>` / `changelog` / `doc-update` / `audit`. Wired into `soma-dev` as `soma-dev delegate | soma-dev workflow`. Eliminates manually orchestrating multiple `soma-dev children run` calls.

- **3 new child role bodies** (s01-ae942e). `body/children/issue_investigator.md` (read-mostly root-cause tracer for nightly failures — writes `/tmp/fix-brief.md`), `body/children/pr_author.md` (writes rich PR descriptions from a brief, voice-hygiene + solo-editorial inherited), `body/children/changelog_curator.md` (curates `[Unreleased]` narratives from git-cliff output, replaces auto-appended bullet noise). Past-self in s01-8b3cb3 declared the roles in `delegate.sh` + CHANGELOG narratives but the body files were never written — every `soma-dev delegate ci-fix` call would have failed at phase 1 with `role 'X' not found in body/children/...`. Surfaced via the s01-ae942e smoke; fixed in the same session.

- **`tests/test-children-roles-exist.sh`** (s01-ae942e). Drift-prevention regression test: extracts every `_run_role` reference from `delegate.sh`, asserts a matching `body/children/<role>.md` exists, plus validates required frontmatter fields. Catches the s01-8b3cb3 class of "declared role, missing body" drift before it ships.

- **`soma-dev check-phases` pre-release gate** (s01-8b3cb3). 30-second sanity check (upstream sync + tests + tsc) before running the full 5-minute `soma-release-prepare.sh` orchestrator. Exits non-zero if any of the three signals is off, saving the cost of a full prepare run that would fail.

### Changed

- **Pi runtime: `0.72.1` → `0.73.1`** (s01-8b3cb3, commit `42ef127`). All 4 pi-* packages bumped together (`pi-coding-agent`, `pi-ai`, `pi-agent-core`, `pi-tui`) per the lockstep rule — mismatched bumps cause silent API mismatches (e.g. `cleanupSessionResources` in pi-ai@0.73.1 not found if pi-ai stayed at 0.72.1). All 7 runtime patches apply cleanly against new upstream; CI green.

- **`docs/anthropic-long-context.md` — long-context wall claim corrected** (s01-ae942e). Previous prose asserted the long-context tier triggers at "~200K" of context, presented as Anthropic-published behavior. That number wasn't sourced; empirical evidence on Curtis's Claude Max plan shows the wall hits at ≈40-48% of Sonnet 4-6's reported 1M context window (~400-480K tokens) — substantially higher than the doc claimed. Three prose blocks + the per-model behavior table updated with hedge language naming the empirical observation; users probe their own account threshold via the `extra usage required for long context` 429.

### Fixed

- **Release flow consolidation** (s01-8b3cb3). `soma-ship.sh` (both in `repos/agent/scripts/_dev/` and `.soma/amps/scripts/internal/`) archived to `_archive/pre-orchestrator-v0.22.x/` — it referenced `repos/agent-stable` (dead since SX-652 worktree topology) and a 10-phase spiral that no longer exists. `soma-dev ship` replaced with clean `git push meetsoma dev` (branch guard + unpushed count). `soma-dev release` now routes to `prepare/ship/beta` subcommands.

- **3 stale model-ID references** (s01-ae942e). Test fixture in `scripts/_dev/tests/test-children-list.sh` referenced `claude-sonnet-4-5`; verify script `scripts/_dev/soma-verify.sh` referenced `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` (a generation-old alias); `scripts/soma-model-sync.sh` error-message hint suggested retired IDs. All bumped to current available IDs. Behavior defaults intentionally NOT changed: `core/delegate/models.ts` MODEL_ALIASES still pin sonnet/haiku/opus to 4-5 (default-tier safety — bumping aliases would silently force users onto 1M-context variants and their long-context billing tier).

- **Premature v0.26.3 roadmap entry removed from website** (s01-ae942e). Past-self in s01-8b3cb3 drafted a v0.26.3 entry covering the autonomous CI/CD work but the version was never released (`npm view meetsoma version` = 0.26.2). Entry deleted; this work surfaces under v0.27.0.

## [0.26.2] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.

- **`extraUsageRecovery` setting** (default `"auto"`, s01-c62a62, cycle 13 successor). Narrow-scoped recovery for the boot-turn-after-`/inhale` variant of Anthropic's `extra usage` 400 error. When `/inhale` rotates the session and the first API call returns Anthropic's `"You're out of extra usage. Add more at claude.ai/settings/usage and keep going."`, Soma surfaces a single notice and auto-injects `.` after a 1s debounce so the conversation advances and subsequent turns can run cleanly. Three modes: `"auto"` (default — notify + auto-`.`), `"notify"` (notice only; user sends any message to continue), `"off"` (silent — Pi's raw error display passes through). Hard fence: only fires when error contains literal `"extra usage"` AND `turnCount <= 2` AND no keepalive fired. Auto-injection is 1 char (`.`) — no full-context resend, no 2× billing amplifier (the SX-709 failure mode that killed the original auto-retry stays killed). Migration phase doc: `migrations/phases/v0.26.1-to-v0.26.2.md`. Plan: `.soma/cycles/audit-fix/13-startup-only-retry-redesign/cycle.md`.

<!-- Entries accumulate here and get promoted to a versioned section on release. -->

## [0.26.1] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Cycle 21 — `test-release-completeness.sh` Section 4 in-flight aware** (s01-c62a62). The npm/package.json drift gate now respects the existing `IN_FLIGHT_VERSION` guard (same pattern as Section 2 dev↔main parity and `test-version-truth.sh` cycle 18). During the release ship window, `npm test` ran in orchestrator Step 4 (preflight) was reporting a real drift that resolved moments later when Step 5 (`soma-npm-publish.sh`) bumped + committed npm/package.json. Now skips cleanly with a SKIP not FAIL during ship. Re-run post-ship for verification.

- **Cycle 22 — `soma:github.local_*` runtime ship gap** (s01-c62a62, commit `005005e`). The 8 local-mode caps shipped in v0.24.0 (`local_path` / `local_map` / `local_find` / `local_refs` / `local_blast` / `local_structure` / `cache_list` / `cache_clean`) registered cleanly on the route bus but failed at runtime in every install with `"ERROR: soma-github-cache.sh not found at /var/folders/.../T/"` because `compile-pro-scripts.sh` PRO_SCRIPTS list bundled `soma-github` without its companion cache helper. Static-only `test-namespaced-caps.sh` never invoked the caps so the gap was invisible. Fix (Option A — inline w/ clean-extraction markers): refactored `soma-github-cache.sh` case-dispatcher into named `_cache_*` functions wrapped in `{{INLINE-LIFT-START / END}}` markers; `soma-github.sh` got `{{INLINE-START / END}}` markers + a comment block explaining the rationale + clean-extraction pattern (so cache can later be promoted to a separate Pro tool); new `lift-cache-helper.sh` build gate (idempotent, hooked into `compile-pro-scripts.sh`) regenerates the inline block from canonical before b64-encode. Plus 1 sub-bug fix: `cache_info` dispatcher branch now passes `$REPO` (was empty `$@`). New runtime regression test `tests/test-soma-github-local-runtime.sh` drives the shipped `soma` binary through all 8 caps + a regression guard for the exact "not found" string — 10/10 pass. v0.24.0 marketing/docs surfaces (`docs/_dev/github-scanner.md`, `docs/whats-new.md`, `docs/tools.md`, website mirrors) described correct behavior all along; the fix makes those descriptions true at runtime.

## [0.26.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.

- **Cycle 10 — `_tool-template.ts` modern shape + Pi tool runner runtime guard** (s01-a6b91e). Replaces broken canonical example (2-arg execute, bare-string return) with the contract Pi's runtime actually expects: 5-arg `(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx) => Promise<AgentToolResult>`, including required `label` field. Adds Site G defensive wrap in `pi-agent-core/agent-loop.js executePreparedToolCall` so any tool returning a string OR an object with undefined `.content` gets lifted into the canonical `{content: [{type:"text", text}], details}` envelope before persistence. Closes the bare-string-return bug class that was producing malformed toolResult records (no `.content` key) and crashing downstream consumers (renderer, compaction, anthropic provider). Verified all 7 runtime patches still needed against upstream Pi 0.73.0 main — audit recorded in `.soma/cycles/audit-fix/10-pi-tool-result-shape-mismatch/VERIFY.md`.

- **Cycle 10 — 6 defensive runtime guards against malformed `ToolResult.content`** (s01-a6b91e). Added Sites A-F across 4 files: `render-utils.getTextOutput`, `tool-execution.maybeConvertImagesForKitty`, `tool-execution.updateDisplay`, `compaction.estimateTokens`, `pi-ai/anthropic.convertContentBlocks`, plus `pi-tui/terminal.start` process-exit cleanup (CSI-u + bracketed-paste + modifyOtherKeys + raw-mode restoration so terminal doesn't leak escape sequences into shell after TUI crash). Defense-in-depth: Site G prevents the malformation upstream; Sites A-F catch anything that slips past.

- **Cycle 12 — Preload notify state machine** (s01-a6b91e). `extensions/soma-breathe.ts` replaces the every-turn-end "🟢 Preload saved..." notify with a transition-only state machine (`'none' | 'saved' | 'stale'`). Adds yellow stale notify (`🟡 Preload now stale (N tool calls...)`) and green refresh notify (`🟢 Preload refreshed`) on STALE→SAVED. Single source of truth for the stale threshold (`PRELOAD_STALE_TOOL_COUNT = 5`); `breathe:detail` route cap exposes `isStale`/`staleThreshold`/`notifyState` for downstream consumers (statusline + soma-boot). Removes dead opt-in `breathe.preloadStaleThreshold` setting (was default 0 = disabled).

- **Cycle 14 — Regression tests for runtime patches** (s01-a6b91e). 27 new gates across 3 test scripts (`test-tool-result-content-guard.sh`, `test-pi-ai-anthropic-content-guard.sh`, `test-pi-tui-exit-cleanup.sh`) lock Sites A-G against regression. Plus `test-preload-notify-state-machine.sh` (15 gates) for cycle 12. Total: 42 new test gates, 100% passing.

- **Cycle 03-meta — META_CYCLE.md adoption** (s01-a6b91e). New `releases/META_CYCLE.md` umbrella dashboard (live state + cycles index + routing + cross-cycle artifact pointers + pattern + changelog). Pattern adopted from a peer soma instance (s01-ddcd84) v0.1.0; meetsoma is domain #2 of the validation arc that muscle's "Strengthen" phase needs.

- **Three new disciplines locked as muscles** (s01-a6b91e):
  - `amps/muscles/meta-cycle-pattern.md` — single SoT per cycle; umbrella META_CYCLE.md dashboard; persistent service artifacts at `<umbrella>/<service>/`.
  - `amps/muscles/verify-patch-against-upstream.md` — `git show upstream/main:<path>` from your local pi-mono clone BEFORE adding any `apply-patches.sh` entry. Don't patch what upstream already fixed.
  - `amps/muscles/blast-radius-before-change.md` — `soma:code.blast` + regression test BEFORE claiming a fix shipped. No claim-shipped without a test.

- **`docs/extending.md` § Cache-safe registration vs hot-reload** — four-concept table (cache-safe registration / module hot-reload / prompt rebuild / subprocess pickup) with explicit "don't conflate the four" rule. Cited authority: `agent-session.js:1894`, `loader.js:271`, soma-boot cache-stickiness, Pi changelog 0.56.0 (#1720), `meta-tool-factory.ts:96-130`, `soma-addons/code.ts:38`. Decision matrix: per-edit-class × cache-impact × what-to-run.

- **`docs/commands.md` § `/reload`** — row clarified to cover both `pi.registerTool` and `route.provide` registration shapes. Pair-with-`/rebuild` guidance for prompt-visible field edits.

- **`body/body.md` Before Doing X table** — added 4 new routing rows (verify-patch-against-upstream, blast-radius-before-change, meta-cycle-pattern, runtime-patch entry).

- **5 queued cycles for follow-up work** filed in `.soma/cycles/`:
  - `audit-fix/11-soma-inhale-double-preload-load` — deep code trace done, hypothesis space narrowed (H-A/H-B/H-C), smoke recipe ready for runtime repro.
  - `audit-fix/13-startup-only-retry-redesign` — Pi 0.73 retry regex audited; gap = DNS/TLS/handshake errors; needs Curtis's actual error class to scope.
  - `audit-fix/15-stale-test-cleanup-sx727-sx734` — deletes stale tests asserting reverted features.

### Fixed
- **cycle 15 — delete stale SX-727/SX-734 tests + replacement upstream-tracking gate (s01-a6b91e)**

- **CHANGELOG entries from s01-a54f21 reflect what was originally shipped, not what's currently on `main`.** Two entries below describe features that were subsequently REVERSED or further GUTTED in the same session and not back-propagated to this changelog:
  - **SX-727 (`context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header patch) — REVERSED** in commit `da6b971` (s01-a54f21). Always-on header rejected requests on accounts without long-context billing (Curtis's case). Patch is DISABLED in `apply-patches.sh`; manifest entry marked `"removed": "2026-05-04"`. To re-enable as opt-in, see SX-741 (auto-apply on settings flip). Original CHANGELOG entry retained below for ancestry; reality is the patch does NOT ship.
  - **SX-734 (billing-retry gate) — FULLY GUTTED** in commit `7109ce1` (s01-a54f21). The `autoRetryBilling` setting gate landed (commit 54f7ef5), then SX-738 fixed undefined-settings ref (commit e403fab), then the entire layer was REMOVED — letting Pi handle billing errors natively (its `_isRetryableError` correctly excludes `extra usage`). Existing `tests/test-billing-retry-disabled.sh` is now stale and fails; cycle 15 plans cleanup.

  Both entries above need cleanup before this changelog is promoted to a versioned section. Cycle 15 (`audit-fix/15-stale-test-cleanup-sx727-sx734`) deletes the stale tests; the CHANGELOG entries themselves should be either removed or rewritten as REVERSED markers.

### Original (stale) entries — retained for ancestry, do NOT promote as-is

- **SX-737 stable-v0.25.0 fallback branch + generic switch ref**
- **Pi 0.72.1 bump** (SX-732). Updates `pi-ai`, `pi-coding-agent`, `pi-tui`, `pi-agent-core` from 0.71.0 to 0.72.1. Unlocks `shouldStopAfterTurn` agent loop callback (Pi 0.72.0+) — documented use case: *"request a graceful stop after the current turn, e.g. before context gets too full"* — the canonical mechanism for the upcoming v0.27 auto-breathe redesign. Pi's internal API rename (`compat.reasoningEffortMap` → `thinkingLevelMap`) audited clean: zero usage in Soma extensions. Removed providers (Gemini CLI / Antigravity) we don't reference. `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities post-bump.
- **~~Anthropic `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header patch~~** (SX-727) — REVERSED s01-a54f21 commit `da6b971`. See "Fixed" section above for full context. Original entry: *Soma now adds `context-1m-2025-08-07` to Anthropic's OAuth `anthropic-beta` header via `scripts/_dev/patches/apply-patches.sh`. Without this opt-in, Sonnet 4.6 hits the long-context billing tier ("extra usage" wall) at ~400K tokens.*
- **Doctor migration: `## Next Session` → `## Start Here` in active preloads** (SX-733). Closes the SX-729 loop for existing user preloads. Sentinel-gated `applyOnce("memory-section-rename-v0.26.0")` in BOTH Tier 1 sites (`extensions/soma-boot.ts` + `npm/thin-cli.js`). Strict heading-only regex; `_archive/` untouched (provenance). New regression test: `tests/test-memory-section-rename-migration.sh` (7 scenarios).
- **~~Billing-error auto-retry disabled by default~~** (SX-734) — GATE GUTTED s01-a54f21 commit `7109ce1`. See "Fixed" section above for full context. Original entry: *Fix: gate auto-retry behind `settings.errors.autoRetryBilling` (default `false`). [...] New regression test: `tests/test-billing-retry-disabled.sh` (6 gates).* Reality: the autoRetryBilling gate AND the entire Soma billing-retry layer are now removed; Pi handles billing errors natively.

## [0.25.0] — 2026-05-04

<!-- Entries accumulate here and get promoted to a versioned section on release. -->

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **Preflight update prompt** (s01-86b0fd). Cached `~/.soma/config.json:updateAvailable` (set by `soma-statusline` background check) now surfaces an interactive prompt at startup: `(c)ontinue / (u)pdate now / (s)kip this version`. Skip persists via `skipUpdateUntilTs` matched against `updateCheckTs` — new commits arrive, prompt re-fires. Zero network at boot. Replaces the misfiring Pi-cruft deprecation prompt that nagged on every startup. See `docs/troubleshooting.md § Startup Prompts`.
- **`tests/test-shipped-templates-clean.sh` regression**. Locks the shipped `templates/default/_mind.md` AND the in-code `getDefaultMindTemplate()` fallback against re-introducing redundant `{{protocol_summaries}}` / `{{muscle_digests}}` / `{{scripts_table}}` interpolations. Four gates: source clean, dist mirrors source, warning comment present, fallback string clean.
- **`tests/test-stale-ctx-after-rotation.sh` regression**. Static-scan + Pi `runner.js invalidate(...)` snapshot. Catches the SX-713 family (Pi 0.71.0 expanded the stale-ctx guard from `pi.X` to also cover `ctx.X`).
- **`tests/test-mind-prepend-cleanup-migration.sh` + `tests/test-preflight-prompt.sh`** — fixture-based migration tests for v0.25.0 changes.
- **Migration map `migrations/phases/v0.24.1-to-v0.25.0.md`** documenting the body/_mind.md cleanup migration + always-run sentinel pattern + preflight prompt.

### Changed
- **Migrations now run UNCONDITIONALLY** (s01-86b0fd). Previously gated behind `if (status.needsMigration)` (project version < agent version), missing users on current version with no sentinel — e.g. fresh init at current version, or manual settings.json edit. Now `applyOnce()` migrations run on every boot/doctor invocation; sentinels make them O(1) idempotent. Affects both `extensions/soma-boot.ts` Tier 1 and `npm/thin-cli.js` doctor mirror.
- **Doc updates**: `docs/troubleshooting.md` gains a `## Startup Prompts` section. `docs/getting-started.md` mentions the preflight prompt at first run. `docs/body.md` and `body/DNA.md` updated with the rationale for why `{{protocol_summaries}} / {{muscle_digests}} / {{scripts_table}}` are NOT in the shipped `_mind.md` template (compileFrontalCortex prepends them).
- **`amps/muscles/internal/route-plumbing-first.md`**: TL;DR + symptom table now cover `ctx.X` access post-rotation (was `pi.X` only). Pi 0.71.0 expanded the guard.

### Fixed
- **`/inhale` stale-ctx after Pi 0.71.0 guard expansion** (s01-86b0fd). `extensions/soma-boot.ts` `/inhale` handler made 3 `ctx.ui.notify` calls AFTER `await ctx.newSession({})`, which Pi 0.71.0's expanded `runner.js invalidate()` guard now flags as stale. Fix: drop 2 redundant success notifies, route the degraded-state warning through `getRoute()?.get("ui:notify")`. Same family as SX-713 (`pi.sendUserMessage` post-rotation); muscle updated.
- **`getDefaultMindTemplate()` inline fallback cleaned** (s01-86b0fd). The fallback string at `core/body.ts:925` (used in test environments / `/soma debug` output when no shipped template is present) still interpolated `{{protocol_summaries}}\n\n{{muscle_digests}}` — inconsistent with the shipped template since `fcd32bd`. Fixed; locked by the new `test-shipped-templates-clean.sh`.
- **Pi-cruft startup warnings removed** (s01-86b0fd). `npm/migrations.js` `checkDeprecatedExtensionDirs` (Pi-inherited via SX-391 absorption) was warning users with `.soma/tools/` (Python scripts), `.soma/hooks/`, or `.soma/commands/` directories — none of which are Soma conventions. The Pi-rename history (Pi's old `tools/` → `extensions/` migration) doesn't apply to Soma. Function preserved as a no-op stub for future Soma-specific deprecations; warnings no longer fire.


## [0.24.1] — 2026-05-03

<!-- Entries accumulate here and get promoted to a versioned section on release. -->

### Fixed
- **SX-722 — release-ship Step 7 silently swallowed pull failures** (`dcf8a3c`). `soma-release-ship.sh` was `(cd ~/.soma/agent && git pull ... || true)` and printed `✓ runtime updated` regardless of outcome. v0.24.0 shipped with the runtime worktree silently stuck at v0.23.0 because of this. Now: `git pull --ff-only`, then verify `package.json` version matches `NEW_VERSION` post-pull; on mismatch print full diagnostic + manual fix path and exit 1.
- **scrape: `mkdir -p` dest before writing llms.txt** (`1ad8469`). Silent failure when `_website/` wasn't created — previously lost a fetched llms.txt this way (2026-04-27, lightpanda). Found as uncommitted edit on the runtime worktree during the s01-f1230f cycle pass; lifted to dev. (`scripts/_pro/*` is gitignored from soma-beta release — dev/main only.)
- **tsconfig hygiene** (`9f6b091`). Added `extensions/_archive/**` to `tsconfig.json` exclude. Cleared 15 TS7006 errors from `_archive/sx594-flat-wrappers/` that `npm run check` was reporting. Archived code shouldn't be type-checked.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **`tests/test-release-completeness.sh` regression** (`9f6b091`). Asserts CHANGELOG ↔ git tag parity, dev ↔ main ff-merge reachability, `dist/manifest.json` ↔ `package.json`, `npm/package.json` ↔ `package.json` (SX-659 collapsed train). Wired into orchestrator Phase 1 (tests gate) automatically because `soma-release-prepare.sh` iterates `tests/test-*.sh`. If a previous release was incomplete (main behind), the next prepare fails CONFLICT-HARD before any new bump — the proactive layer of the SX-722 prevention rule.
- **`tests/test-namespaced-caps.sh` regression** (`9f6b091`). Static-analysis floor for the cap-bus surface (~92 registered caps): per-family minimum thresholds, v0.24.0 named-cap presence (18 specific caps from CHANGELOG), duplicate-registration detection, namespace hygiene. Catches accidental cap deletion or rename across all addons before runtime.



## [0.24.0] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **add required Actions section to v0.23.0-to-v0.23.1.md**
- **bump pi-* to 0.71.0 — clears CVE-2026-41686 (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf)**
- **Bump pi-* deps 0.71.0 + clear CVE-2026-41686 (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf)** — upgraded `@earendil-works/pi-{ai,coding-agent,tui,agent-core}` from `^0.69.0` to `^0.71.0`. Clears `@anthropic-ai/sdk` advisory (affects `>=0.79.0 <0.91.1`). Also picks up: cache-control model-compat awareness, fine-grained tool streaming beta, empty tools array fix, stream truncation detection. fast-xml-parser (AWS Bedrock SDK transitive) remains at moderate — not reachable through soma's Anthropic provider path.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma:github.* v2 (SX-720)** — 21 caps total. API-mode (metadata; 13 caps including new audit/releases/diff/compare/file_diff parity wires) + new local-mode (tarball + soma-code shim; 8 caps): `local_path`, `local_map`, `local_find`, `local_refs`, `local_blast`, `local_structure`, `cache_list`, `cache_clean`. Treat any GitHub repo as local: fetch tarball ~1–5s to `~/.soma/cache/gh/<owner>--<repo>--<sha>/`, then run soma-code (12 langs, full ripgrep regex, DEF/IMP/USE refs, blast radius). Architectural pivot from "per-file API" to "fetch-once-then-local-toolchain." Plan: `releases/v0.23.x/plans/github-tool-10x.md`. Commits: `e7ff177`, `907013a`, `96a511c`. Guide: `docs/_dev/github-scanner.md`.
- **dev:kanban.* (SX-720)** — dev-only ticket audit caps. `dev:kanban.audit({ticket})`, `dev:kanban.audit_batch({tickets|all_open|all, mode?})`, `dev:kanban.audit_open()`. Triangulates kanban + git log + soma:code.* + sessions/preloads + cross-project trees (somaverse/somadian/website). Verdicts: SHIPPED / STALE / **STALE-CROSS-PROJECT** / STILL-VALID / NEEDS-REPRO / UNCLEAR. Used to close SX-588/SX-589/SX-642 in same session. Build-excluded from npm tarball. Commit: `4d667a3`. Guide: `docs/_dev/kanban-audit.md`.
- **soma:docs.* upgrade (SX-720)** — 5 caps total. New: `whats_new({version?, limit?: 3})` reads `docs/whats-new.md` (agent-facing changelog); `guide({name})` resolves `guides/` then `_dev/`. Improved: `list` is now recursive (catches `guides/` and `_dev/`), groups by section, extracts TL;DR per entry; `show` accepts subdir paths. New `docs/whats-new.md` populated with v0.23.1 + v0.23.0 sections (action-oriented invocation hints). New `docs/_dev/` subdir convention (build-excluded; gated by filesystem presence). Commits: `75b78f9`, `a7fe2f8`.
- **Heat-system docs: cold-start boost (SX-708)** — added `## New Muscle Visibility (cold-start boost)` section to `docs/heat-system.md` (formula, code excerpt from `core/utils.ts:215-225`, scope, budget-overflow detail, verifying checklist). Mirrored to `docs/muscles.md` `## Heat & Loading Tiers`. Commit: `e4fdbe2`.
- v3.1 — Tier 1 wins from ripgrep study (0be844f)
- v3 agent-first redesign — never hangs, self-correcting, auto-detects (28a5850)
- add Phase 5.6 version-truth gate (5798e66)
- add Phase 5.5 website-readiness gate (6478fc3)

### Changed
- **breathe.auto now opt-in by default (SX-718)** — proactive auto-rotation at `rotateAt%` (default 70%) wipes user input mid-compose with no warning. Existing users with `breathe.auto: true` are flipped once via Tier 1 migration `breathe-auto-off-v0.23.1`; sentinel recorded in `settings.migrations[]` so re-enable is respected. Migration map: `migrations/phases/v0.23.0-to-v0.23.1.md`. Also introduces the reusable `applyOnce(id, fn)` pattern + `settings.migrations[]` tracker for future one-time semantic migrations beyond `addIfMissing`.
- Phase 5.5 calls test-release-surfaces.sh (closes SX-510) (a6302c1)
- meetsoma@0.23.0 (18f9c1d)

### Fixed
- soma-github: follow 301 redirects on moved repos (curl -sL) (`96a511c`)
- SX-713 inhale stale-after-reload — consume message:send via route (cf18064)
- SX-717 default path + clarify legacy soma:code.find description (2a313fc)
- SX-716 walk up looking for agent package.json on fallback A (17b9f1e)
- SX-715 auto-detect github.com remote name + surface fetch errors (53cbed7)
- SX-714 persist version bump in no-fixes branch (86213f2)
- rewrite CHANGELOG promotion regex for our actual format (2034516)
- manually promote [Unreleased] → [0.23.0] (orchestrator regex bug) (2b578f4)


## [0.23.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **tree-hygiene gate (Phase 0.5, SX-712)** — `soma-release-prepare.sh` halts if `repos/agent/` has uncommitted files other than ` M CHANGELOG.md`. Closes the agent-spawned-files-leaking-into-soma-beta hole observed s01-030d41. Override with `--skip-tree-hygiene` (writes audit trail). `.releaseignore` widened to cover `.soma/`, `.husky/`, `node_modules/`.
- **`soma:agent.list` role filter (SX-701)** — pass `{role: 'librarian'}` (or any role string) to filter children by role. Stacks with existing `active_only`/`all`/`cleanup` filters. Useful when a parent has spawned multiple roles and wants to inspect just one cohort.
- **somadian drift discipline — verify + lift + pre-commit gate (SOMADIAN-002, s01-ef2bdc)** — three scripts that enforce byte-identical shared code across the 4 somadian bins (cloud / enterprise / local / sidecar): `somadian-verify` detects drift, `somadian-mirror` lifts a canonical bin to the others, and `install-hooks.sh` wires a pre-commit gate that blocks divergent commits. Closes the silent-drift hole.
- **namespace-rooted workspace target path (s01-ef2bdc)** — `soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh` now writes to `~/.soma/<namespace>/workspaces/__legacy__/...` (was `~/.soma/workspaces/...`). Aligns with first-name-wins namespace shape (SOMAVERSE-019).
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **soma-somaverse-deploy.sh — closes the build-vs-stamp race for somaverse (s01-680a9c, SOMAVERSE-009)** — mirrors `soma-somadian-deploy.sh` for the somaverse side. Enforces commit → build → deploy → verify ordering. The somaverse build embeds `git rev-parse HEAD` as the cache-buster (`main.js?v=<sha>`); building with uncommitted changes makes the deployed bundle report an older sha than its actual contents. Caught s01-680a9c cycle 10 mid-deploy. Builds: `local` (build-only), `enterprise` (→ a client enterprise host), `vps` (→ somaverse.ai). End-to-end smoke verified live on enterprise build.
- **soma-somadian-deploy.sh — closes the build-vs-rsync race (s01-1bf0bb Cycle 15)** — enforces commit→rsync→build→deploy→verify order. Includes `rollback` command. Future deploys won't have stamp-vs-source mismatch. The Cycle 13 build had this race (binary had Cycle 13.5 fix but git_sha stamp was Cycle 13 commit).
- **soma-voice-switch.sh — voice backend mutex orchestrator (s01-1bf0bb W-3c)** — top-level orchestrator wraps the 3 individual lifecycle scripts and applies the mutex matrix (`use voxtral` kills openvoice + tts-server, starts voxtral; etc.). Used by `somaverse/.../server/bridge.ts` `POST /voice/use-backend` (pane wiring) AND `somaverse-addons/voice.ts` cap (agent surface) — single source of truth. `status` returns JSON for machine consumption.
- **voice-backend lifecycle scripts (s01-1bf0bb)** — 3 dev:* scripts in `scripts/_dev/`:
  - `soma-voxtral.sh` — local mlx Voxtral TTS (port 18795). macOS arm64 only; sweeps orphan procs.
  - `soma-openvoice.sh` — OpenVoice V2 voice-clone server (port 18793). Mirrors soma-racecar pattern.
  - `soma-tts-server.sh` — soma-voice/server/tts-server.py (port 18790, edge-tts + clone routing).
  All 3 build-excluded from npm tarball. Companion: somaverse `somaverse-addons/voice.ts` mutex cap.
  Plan: `.soma/releases/sidecar/consolidated-plan/07-smallest-wedge.md` § W-2.
- **`dev:*` namespace foundation (SX-694)** — new top-level meta-tool family for dev-only operations (`dev:hub.*`, `dev:release.*`, `dev:audit.*`, `dev:lint.*`). Stripped from end-user beta builds via `soma-release.sh` Step 3; verified by `verify-bootstrap-clean.sh` Test 5 (NEW). Dogfood works locally; end users never see `dev:*`.
- **`dev:hub.*` x5 caps (SX-695, SX-696)** — read-only audit-grade introspection of community-tier content: `dev:hub.list` (items by type), `dev:hub.read` (raw markdown), `dev:hub.canonical` (paths), `dev:hub.diff` (vs workspace/fallback), `dev:hub.audit` (drift report). Replaces 5-step shell pipelines with a single cap call.
- **`dev:audit.deps` + `dev:audit.ci` caps** — dependency + CI-config audits surfaced as caps under the new `dev:*` namespace.
- **`soma:code.history` cap (SX-700)** — `git log` for a file as a structured cap (sha + date + author + subject). Replaces 6 raw `git log --format` shell calls observed in a single session. Cap-only addition; zero cache-bust cost.
- **3 missing roles synced + 3 drift fixes** — community-tier `body/children/<role>.md` content reconciled against canonical: 3 roles re-synced and 3 drifted definitions corrected.
- **`soma-dev switch` rewritten for worktree-on-main (SX-686)** — the legacy `soma-switch.sh` managed symlinks pre-SX-652. Replaced with a worktree-aware `soma-dev switch [dev|main|help]`: flips `~/.soma/agent` between branches (detached HEAD on dev since it's checked out in `repos/agent`), rebuilds `dist/`, ff-pulls main. `paths.sh` now exports `AGENT_RUNTIME` (canonical); `AGENT_STABLE` retained as deprecated alias.
- **frozen-protocols fallback warning (SX-691)** — stepping stone before SX-691-full removal: when `build-dist.mjs` falls back to `repos/agent/.soma/protocols/` (frozen at v0.6.6), it now logs a triple-warning and labels the source `agent .soma/ (FROZEN v0.6.6)` so anyone hitting the fallback sees they're shipping stale content. Fully removed in the SX-691 fix below.
- **release-please proposer workflow + config (SX-667)** — `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` opens release PRs from conventional commits. Manual-trigger only (workflow_dispatch) until first proposer-output validation. Activates on default branch after next release sync.
- **`gh release create` as Step 6.5 of `soma-release-ship.sh` (S4, SX-667)** — auto-publishes a GitHub Release with generated notes on every release. Idempotent + non-fatal.
- **Full Step 4 log on failure (S2, SX-667)** — `soma-release-ship.sh` now captures full `soma-release.sh` output to `/tmp/soma-release-step4-v$VERSION.log` and dumps the entire log on failure (was `tail -10`).

### Fixed
- **`body/STATE.md` now scaffolds on fresh init (SX-669 follow-through)** — SX-669 (s01-88d4bd) retired the root `.soma/STATE.md` scaffold and declared `body/STATE.md` the canonical state slot. The migration comment in `core/init.ts:608` said `body/STATE.md` would be created by `templates/default/body/STATE.md` (handled by `scaffoldBody`) — but no `STATE.md` was ever added to `templates/default/`. Result: fresh init never created `STATE.md` anywhere, but the `_memory.md` preload template still told users to "Update STATE.md if branches, versions, or known bugs changed." Latent for ~6 weeks. Caught by sandbox smoke-test s01-b97ce5. Now ships a generic skeleton (Versions / Services / Tools / Known bugs / Recent shifts).
- **`soma-release-prepare.sh` commit-msg-lint regex synced with `.git-hooks/commit-msg` (SX-702 follow-through)** — SX-702 fixed the hook to allow `.` in scope (`[a-z0-9_.-]+`) so dotted cap-name scopes like `agent.list` and `code.history` would pass. The companion regex in the orchestrator at `soma-release-prepare.sh:281` was missed and still rejected dots. Result: every dotted-scope commit was flagged NEEDS-REVIEW by the orchestrator even though the hook accepted it. Synced.
- **`soma-sandbox.sh --main` worktree-aware (s01-b97ce5)** — pre-SX-652 the main branch lived at `$MEETSOMA/repos/agent-stable`. Post-SX-652 it lives at `$HOME/.soma/agent` (worktree-on-main). The `--main` source path was never updated and silently failed (`agent-stable not found`). Now points at the canonical runtime worktree.
- **`soma-dev sandbox` wrapper repaired (s01-b97ce5)** — the wrapper at `scripts/_dev/soma-dev/commands/sandbox.sh` redirected to `$SOMA_DIR/amps/scripts/internal/soma-sandbox.sh`, a path that moved during s01-c6944c consolidation. Wrapper was missed; `soma-dev sandbox` was silently broken for ~5 weeks. Now forwards to `scripts/_dev/sandbox/soma-sandbox.sh` (canonical kit).
- **`soma-new` no longer pollutes agent install with spawned content (SX-710)** — `resolve_soma_dir()` walks up from `$PWD` looking for any `.soma/`; when invoked from inside `~/.soma/agent/`, it would resolve to the install's own dogfood `.soma/` (source-controlled, not a valid user-content target). Any `soma:new.muscle` / `soma:new.protocol` / `soma:new.child` call from inside the install would write into `~/.soma/agent/.soma/amps/...`. Fix: skip `~/.soma/agent/.soma` (symlink-safe via `pwd -P`) and continue the walk-up. Latent bug — no pollution found today, but the class is now closed.
- **`build-dist.mjs` removes v0.6.6 protocols fallback entirely (SX-691 full)** — the fallback silently shipped frozen v0.6.6 protocols when `repos/community/` wasn't cloned alongside `repos/agent/`. 5 core protocols had drifted between canonical and frozen (verified by `dev:hub.audit`). Build now exits 1 with a clear pointer (`gh repo clone meetsoma/community`) instead of shipping stale.
- **commit-msg lint allows `.` in scope (SX-702)** — conventional-commit scope regex was `[a-z0-9_-]+`, rejecting dotted scopes like `agent.list` and `code.history` (which match cap names). Caught when `feat(agent.list): ...` was silently rejected and `git push` said "Everything up-to-date" — cost ~2 min to diagnose. Fix: add `.` to the scope class.
- **commit-msg lint accepts `revert` type** — was missing from `VALID_TYPES`; needed for `git revert` commits to pass the gate.
- **GitHub repo URL reverted to canonical `meetsoma/soma-agent` (SX-704)** — a prior "canonicalization" (71c2c62) flipped the URL the wrong direction. `gh api` confirmed the canonical name IS `meetsoma/soma-agent`. Both URLs resolve via GitHub redirect, but if the redirect ever drops, the previous direction would break. Reverted in 6 source files + 4 `.soma/` files + 2 git remotes.
- **`soma-channel-guard` hook resolves through symlinks (SX-693)** — the hook is symlinked into each public repo's `.git/hooks/pre-push`. `dirname $0` resolved to `.git/hooks/`, which broke the relative `source _lib/find-root.sh`. Fix: walk through `readlink` until `$0` is no longer a symlink. Affects all 6 public repos using the hook.
- **`test-doctor` version-equality assertion inverted (SX-659 align)** — the test asserted `agent_version != cli_version`; SX-659 (v0.22.1) collapsed the two version trains so they're intentionally equal now. Test was failing because reality finally matched the spec. Inverted: pass when versions match, fail on drift.
- **`soma-release-ship.sh` Step 6 (main-sync) hardened (SX-685)** — dropped three buggy operations silently misbehaving under SX-652 worktree-on-main: `git push origin v$VERSION` (no `origin` remote, only `meetsoma`), `git branch -f main` (fatal under worktree-on-main), `git push --force-with-lease meetsoma main:main` (would silently rewind remote main from a stale local ref). Step 6 is now just the agent-repo tag push; main sync is owned by `soma-release.sh` Step 6.
- **`soma-release-ship.sh` Step 7 worktree detection** — `-d "$HOME/.soma/agent/.git"` was wrong under worktree-on-main (worktrees use a gitfile, not a directory). Silently skipped runtime-pull on every release. Fixed to `-e` (matches dir / file / symlink).

### Changed
_(no other behavior changes this release — see Added/Fixed.)_


## [0.22.1] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **soma:new.child cap + bundled _child-template.md (SX-663)**
- **progressive teach + child monitor improvements (SX-665, SX-666)**
- **cache-TTL rollback on aborted/errored turns (SX-660)**
- **add Phase 1.5 commit-message lint (G1, SX-667)**
- **delegate progressive teaching (SX-665)** — `soma:agent.delegate` bare call (or `{help: true}`) returns a structured help payload: roles available (auto-discovered from `body/children/*.md`), models, recent children, examples, and a notice that async children don't yet ping on completion (see SX-664). Tool teaches itself; saves a tool round-trip when the parent doesn't remember the surface.
- **child monitor improvements (SX-666)** — `soma:agent.list` now defaults to last-7-days (registry can grow long); accepts `{active_only: true}` to filter to running/spawning/completed-not-harvested; accepts `{cleanup: true}` to remove aborted/completed entries >24h old. Pass `{all: true}` to override the 7-day default.
- **`soma:new.child` cap (SX-663)** — scaffold a new child role at `.soma/body/children/<name>.md` from `_child-template.md`, matching `soma:new.muscle` / `soma:new.protocol` pattern. Then edit the scaffold (set summary, default-model, inherits, guidelines), then `delegate({role:'<name>', task:'...'})`. Bundled `_child-template.md` ships with `soma init`.
- **`keepalive.rollbackOnAbort` setting (SX-660, opt-in)** — when `true`, `lastActivityTs` rolls back on aborted/errored turns so the cache-TTL counter doesn't overstate after a Curtis-aborted long-running tool call. Default `false` (no behavior change). Empirical evidence: aborted assistant messages have zero usage — API request never round-trips, so cache wasn't actually refreshed at the optimistic turn_start reset. Opt in via `.soma/settings.json` `keepalive.rollbackOnAbort: true`. See `releases/plans/active/agent-infra/README.md` § SX-660.
- **Pi auto-fix loop on isolated worktree (SX-654)**
- **prepare + ship orchestrator with checklog pattern (SX-653)**
- **collapse agent + thin-CLI version trains (SX-659)**
- **Pi changelog parser utility (Bucket 2 / SX-653 dep)**
- **version-aware path interpolation (SX-656)** — 5 new template vars (`current_version`, `current_series`, `active_plans_dir`, `active_index`, `active_release_dir`) derived from agent_version or `settings.releases.activeSeries` override. New `# Active Release` block in `body/_mind.md`. Eliminates the stale-reference drift on version bumps.
- **externalize overlay manifest + bootstrap-clean verifier (Bucket 2 G+J / SX-653 deps)**

### Fixed
- **cleanup mode prunes all finished entries, no time gate (SX-666 amend)**
- **triage 6 pre-existing test failures (32 assertions)**
- **count cache TTL from turn_start, not turn_end** — `state.lastActivityTs` was reset at `turn_end`, making `cacheRemaining()` overstate by however long the turn took. Anthropic's prompt-cache TTL counts from cache write (= turn_start). Validated against session JSONL: two invalidations both fell within the 300s window measured from turn_end but BOTH past 300s when measured from turn_start. Bumped `keepaliveThresholdSeconds` 45 → 90 as safety margin.
- **migrate to unscoped 'typebox' package (SX-655)** — Pi 0.69.0 renamed `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x → `typebox` 1.x. Migrated 6 imports and added `'typebox'` to all three external arrays in `scripts/build-dist.mjs` (was missed; build size doubled to 611 KB before the fix, recovered to 286.4 KB).


## [0.22.0] — 2026-04-24 — Namespaced meta-tools end-to-end + bridge CLI + init hardening

### Fixed
- **harden pairing flow — secret in header, umask, `curl --fail`, device-key shape-check (SX-audit, s01-d7bdf0)**
- **`SOMAVERSE_DIR` consumers use `builds/local/extensions` (SX-616)**
- **stale-ctx guard on footer render; no more pi-tui crashes post-`/reload` (SX-633)**
- **wire `soma-addons/` + `_shared/` end-to-end; Tier 2 addon-ship through release script (SX-594 Phase 3 / gap-addon-ship.md, SX-610)**
- **`AGENT_VERSION` reads `dist/manifest.json` not `package.json` (SX-624 revises SX-619)**
- **refresh `docs/guides/code-navigator.md` example + cap inventory (pre-release audit stale-ref sweep, s01-e3e1ed)**
- **always stamp `AGENT_VERSION` in settings.json even when user template provides version field (SX-620)**
- **copy `package.json` into `dist/` so `AGENT_VERSION` stamps correctly (SX-619, superseded by SX-624 for runtime path)**
- **backport v0.21 cache economics to bundled defaults (SX-600)**
- **health check reads Pi version from `dist/manifest.json` (authoritative) instead of `CORE_DIR/node_modules` (stale-prone) (SX-622)**
- **ship `templates/` to `dist/` so `body/` scaffolds fully (SX-594)**
- **smart partial-state handling + rootName + doctor bail on `soma init` (SX-592)**

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`soma bridge` CLI — `start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`/`logs`/`config`/`setup` (SX-522)** — first-class bridge daemon lifecycle. Works standalone without Somaverse; mirrored by `somaverse:bridge.*` (7 caps) + `somaverse:auth.*` (3 caps) for agent-side automation.
- **`soma:agent.*` meta-tool — `delegate`/`children` collapsed (SX-609)** — 7 caps: `delegate`, `list`, `tail`, `steer`, `kill`, `harvest`, `focus` (focus op recovered from original plan). Extension shrank 606→330 lines.
- **`soma:focus.*` / `soma:new.*` / `soma:terminals.*` — 11 new caps wrapping bundled CLIs.** Also fixed `soma focus` dispatcher's inverted discovery order.
- **`soma-install.sh dev` cross-repo extension union + `node_modules` symlink (SX-629)** — reproducible end-to-end; fixed a latent Pi 0.66.1→0.69.0 drift.
- **`soma:docs.*` for bundled docs search + retrieval (SX-594 Phase 3 Step C + SX-588 + SX-596)**
- **progressive-awareness entry point for meta-tools (SX-594)** — bare-prefix family discovery + `op='help'` block for every meta-tool.
- **`soma:body.*` (slots/cost/audit) from `dev:body.*` move (SX-594 Phase 3 Step B)**
- **family-level capability discovery via bare-prefix call (SX-594)**
- **register `soma:*` meta-tool + `soma:browser.*` (17 caps, SX-594 Phase 2 Step C)** — direct-CDP default; bridge required only for advanced ops (evaluate, styles, emulate, performance).
- **v0.22.0 version infrastructure + `soma-release --vbump` / `--vaudit` + dev-install package.json symlink (SX-622)**
- **hash-based bundled template drift refresh (SX-621)** — doctor auto-refreshes pristine-older body templates to current bundled; warns with diff path for customized files. Keyed off `migrations/template-hashes.json` shipped with the agent.
- **Pi runtime upgrade 0.67.68 → 0.69.0 (SX-623)** — 42 upstream commits (17 coding-agent fixes, 4 new features, 5 ai fixes, 2 tui fixes). Non-breaking: tool registration + extension API unchanged. Internal refactor: cwd-singleton tool filtering replaced by name-based allowlists (same behavior for extensions that register unique names). Notable improvements: symlink session resolution, skills dedup, xterm uppercase input, shell-path uses session cwd, OpenAI-compatible prompt caching (anthropic-style cache_control).
- **teach `verify` + `symlink` commands about `somaverse-tools` + addons (SX-613)**
- **progressive-awareness retrofit across 4 commands (SX-590)** — `soma body`, `soma tool`, `soma concepts`, `soma-dev status` now emit a curated `What next:` block after every state. Bare command == `--help`. Suppressed when piped (isatty check). Helper `soma_next_steps` added to `scripts/soma-theme.sh`; parallel `next_steps` in `scripts/_dev/soma-dev/lib/colors.sh`. Muscle: `amps/muscles/cli-progressive-awareness.md` (heat 3).
- **`dev:cli.*` addon — 17 soma-shell capabilities (SX-585)** — wraps `soma plans`/`reflect`/`trace`/`concepts`/`threads`/`blog-audit`/`blog-graph`/`body`/`protocol-audit`/`compat` + pro (`refactor`/`github`/`scrape`/`seam`) + dev (`dev`/`deploy`) + `cli.raw` escape. Agents see the CLI surface via `dev(op='list', prefix='dev:cli.')`. Zero cache bust (addon lives outside cached prefix).
- **`docs/amps.md` + `docs/migrating.md` seeded from website (SX-586)** — the two website-only docs now have agent-side sources. Next `sync-to-website.sh` run is a no-op (zero byte drift verified). Future edits happen agent-side.

### Changed
- **SX-594 wrapper sweep — archived deprecation shims (SX-601)** — `workspace_*`, `plugin_state_*`, flat `browser_*`, `code_*`, `dev:ai.*`, `dev:body.*`, `file_outline` no longer register at boot. The cached prompt no longer carries the double surface. Wrappers moved to `_archive/sx594-flat-wrappers/` in both agent + somaverse repos.
- **Tier C stale-reference sweep across muscles / docs / MAPs (SX-628)** — remaining references to archived flat tool names cleaned up.

### Changed
- **`ai_*` → `dev:ai.*` addon extraction (SX-591 Phase A)** — 5 flat Pi-registered tools (`ai_status`, `ai_load`, `ai_index`, `ai_search`, `ai_embed`) removed from the cached prompt surface; same capabilities behind the `dev` meta-tool. Call via `dev(op='call', cap='dev:ai.search', args={...})`. ~3KB reduction in `cache_creation_input_tokens` per session on cold boot. Pilot for the v0.22.x namespaced-meta-tools arc (SX-594).

## [0.21.1.1] — 2026-04-22 — Same-cycle audit patches

Micro-release caught during a post-ship audit of `v0.21.0..HEAD`. Three
findings with real code impact; two dead-code + hygiene tidy-ups.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.

- **`soma model-sync` — audit + set `defaultModel` across all scopes.** New
  bundled script `scripts/soma-model-sync.sh`. Audits global
  (`~/.soma/settings.json`) + project (`<cwd>/.soma/settings.json`) + any
  `.soma/` dirs under `$HOME` (with `--crawl`). `--set <id>` writes
  everywhere; `--yes` skips confirmation; idempotent. Bundled default is
  `claude-opus-4-7` (the latest Opus on Claude Max plans). Creates
  `settings.json` where missing; preserves all unrelated keys in files
  that are already populated. Closes the "keep every project on the
  current model without hand-editing" gap. 23-assertion test suite at
  `tests/test-model-sync.sh`. Guide: `docs/guides/sane-defaults.md`.

### Fixed

- **TmuxDriver shell-quoting.** `tmuxExec` used `JSON.stringify` per-arg,
  which wraps in **double** quotes — bash double-quotes let `$(...)` +
  backticks + `$VAR` expand on the parent shell before tmux sees them.
  A task like `"list files in $(pwd)/logs"` would arrive at the child
  with `$(pwd)` already substituted for the parent's cwd. Switched to
  single-quote wrapping with the classic `'\''` escape for embedded
  quotes. Verified against 7 edge cases (plain, single + double quotes,
  backticks, `$()`, paths, semicolons — all round-trip literal).

  Not a security bug (self-injection only; same user), but a correctness
  bug that landed in v0.21.1 and would surface the first time a user
  wrote a task with shell metacharacters.

- **`soma-model-sync` shell-to-python interpolation.** `read/write_default_model`
  built python `-c` source via `$var` interpolation. A model id with a
  single quote character (or shell metacharacter) would break the `-c`
  block. Moved path + model to env vars (`SOMA_MS_PATH`, `SOMA_MS_MODEL`);
  python source is now static.

- **`.gitignore`: `__pycache__/` + `*.pyc`.** An accidentally-tracked
  `scripts/__pycache__/soma-children.cpython-313.pyc` landed in the
  v0.21.1 agent dev commits. Confirmed it did NOT ship to soma-beta
  (`.releaseignore` filtered it), so no user runtime impact. Cleaned up +
  prevented future recurrence.

- **Dead code removed.** `shEscape` helper in `core/terminal-drivers/tmux.ts`
  was orphaned after the signature changed during the driver refactor.

- **Import order.** `biome --write --unsafe` on `core/terminal-drivers/index.ts`
  + `extensions/soma-delegate.ts` to match the project's import conventions.

## [0.21.1] — 2026-04-22 — Children control panel + tmux baseline

Patch release. Three themes woven together: complete the background-
delegation surface (Phase B ops), ship background delegation to npm users
(tmux driver), and fix a months-old dead branch in the boot resume path
so the delta-diff and `/reload` signal can actually fire.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.

- **`children` tool — Phase B ops (SX-553)** — `tail` / `steer` / `kill` /
  `harvest` on top of `list`. `tail` uses the driver's capture; `steer`
  sends a chat message (blocked on non-running); `kill` closes the driver
  container + marks aborted; `harvest` returns the MLR placeholder + removes
  the entry from the registry. `findChild(id)` accepts either the child id
  or the driver handle id (e.g. `surface:8`, `soma-child-abc`).
- **TerminalDriver interface + TmuxDriver baseline (SX-580 Phase C.1–C.2)** —
  new `core/terminal-drivers/` package with a unified driver interface. Two
  implementations: `TmuxDriver` (ships to npm — detached tmux sessions,
  attach-on-demand via `tmux attach -t soma-child-<id>`, works on any Unix
  with tmux installed, no TTY issues, CI-compatible) and `CmuxDriver` (dev-
  mode only, existing logic refactored with zero behavior change). Auto-
  pick prefers `tmux > cmux`. `delegate` gains optional `terminal:'tmux'|'cmux'`
  param. `ChildEntry` schema gains `driver`, `handle_id`, `attach_hint`;
  legacy `pane`/`surface` kept for pre-refactor entries. `children list`
  table gains a driver column. **First time `delegate(background:true)`
  works for a non-cmux user in any Soma release.**
- **`soma terminals` CLI + persistent driver preference (SX-580 Phase C.3–C.4)** —
  new bundled `scripts/soma-terminals.sh` modeled on soma-blog's self-describing
  pattern. Subcommands: `list`, `detect` (list + recommendation),
  `status` (current configured driver), `prefer <driver>` (persist to
  `~/.soma/settings.json` `delegate.terminal`), `setup [<driver>]` (install
  walkthrough), `doctor [<driver>]` (diagnose why a driver isn't working).
  `pickDriver()` consults settings before auto-pick. Precedence:
  per-call `terminal:` param → settings → auto-pick. Agent can run
  `soma terminals setup` and walk a user through install when
  `delegate(background:true)` fails with no-driver-available.
- **`/reload` distinguished from resume in boot message** — `soma-boot` now
  stamps `process.pid` on every fingerprint entry. On resume, if the most
  recent entry's PID matches `process.pid`, the extension re-activated in-
  process (= user ran `/reload`) and the boot message becomes
  `[Soma Boot — /reloaded]` with the explicit signal `any 'needs /reload'
  work from the last turn is now live`. Prompt cache is already busted by
  `/reload` so emitting a message here costs nothing. Distinguishes from:
  ctrl-C restart (new PID, resumed session) and periodic checkpoints (not
  a boot at all).
- **Background-delegation guide** — new `docs/guides/background-delegation.md`
  with the sync-vs-background decision tree, tmux install hints, mental
  model, attach-on-demand pattern, full children-ops examples, kill-vs-harvest
  semantics, the MLR-writing gap stated honestly, troubleshooting entries
  for the two surfaced bugs, and a pointer for authoring new drivers.
  `docs/tools.md` + `docs/commands.md` gain cross-links and CLI table rows.
- **Upstream Pi patches shipped as dist overlays:**
  - **pi-tui inline image height cap (SX-579)** — tall clipboard screenshots
    no longer take over the terminal. Capped at a readable row count via
    `PI_TUI_MAX_IMAGE_ROWS` (default 80% of `process.stdout.rows`, min 20).
    Patch is PR-shaped (opt-in, backward-compatible) pending the upstream
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` flow.
  - **Compaction ephemeral-path filter (SX-569)** — `extractFileOpsFromMessage`
    in Pi's compaction util was collecting every `read`/`write`/`edit` path
    into `<read-files>` / `<modified-files>` XML blocks. macOS clipboard
    paste-temp files (`/var/folders/.../T/clipboard-*.jpeg`) + `/tmp/*.{png,jpg,…}`
    screenshots accumulated across compactions. Added `isEphemeralPath(p)`
    guard. Zero payload mutation.

### Fixed

- **Boot resume fingerprint reader was reading the wrong field** — filter
  code read `entry.content?.fingerprint`, but Pi's `SessionManager.appendEntry`
  stores payloads under `entry.data`. The delta-diff branch had been silently
  dead since it was written; every resume fell through to the "no fingerprint"
  fallback. Fixed — delta-diff resume now actually fires when heat or muscles
  changed.
- **`delegate(background:true)` was broken since Phase A shipped** — `CMUX_SCRIPT`
  path resolution used an unset env var + a dev-install symlink that doesn't
  cover `scripts/`. Every call hit "install cmux" even when cmux was running.
  New resolution walks `SOMA_CMUX_SCRIPT` env → `SOMA_CODING_AGENT_DIR` →
  cwd-relative → walk-up → dev-symlink → PATH. Uncovered by end-to-end
  exercise.
- **Model alias leakage to children** — `spawnBackground` passed bare aliases
  (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`) straight to `soma --model`, and Pi's model
  registry picked the wrong provider (`us.anthropic.haiku-4-5` = bedrock)
  in the child's environment. Child died on missing bedrock creds.
  `MODEL_ALIASES` now exported from `core/delegate-core.ts`; aliases are
  pre-resolved to fully-qualified ids (`claude-haiku-4-5`) before building
  the boot command.
- **Registry stayed `running` after a child's container closed** — no auto
  status-transition on pane death. New `reconcileChildStatuses()` pass runs
  at the start of `children(op:'list')`: any registry entry whose driver
  container is gone auto-flips to `completed` with `ended_at`.
- **Channel guard false-positive on `SOMA_PROJECT_DIR`** — the `soma_pro`
  keyword in the guard's pattern matched `SOMA_PROJECT_DIR` env mentions in
  benign output. Narrowed the pattern.

### Verified end-to-end (s01-b1b654)

`delegate(background:true, terminal:'tmux', model:'haiku')` → `children(op:'list')`
→ `tail` → `steer` → `kill` → `harvest` against a real tmux-spawned child.
Child booted in a detached tmux session, executed the task, responded to
steer, kill cleanly closed the session (`tmux ls` confirmed: no server),
harvest returned the summary and removed the registry entry. Model resolved
to `claude-haiku-4-5` end-to-end. Same flow also verified against a
cmux-spawned child earlier in the same session — both drivers work.

Release notes: `.soma/releases/v0.20.x/v0.21.1/release-notes.md`.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-04-22 — Cache Economics + Discoverability + Self-Knowledge

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **suppress preventive OAuth-billing warning at boot (SX-566)**
- **test-audit command + hygiene rule engine (SX-564)**
- **swap Pi's π terminal-title glyph for Soma's σ**
- **Agent Notes relocation + preload ancestry + v0.21.0**
- **Terminal tab title now shows `σ - <session> - <cwd>`** — build-time patch to Pi's `interactive-mode.js` swaps the `π` brand glyph for Soma's `σ`. Display-only, zero cache/payload impact. Closes the last Pi brand leak in the TUI chrome.
- **Declarative migration replay via map frontmatter (SX-562)** — `soma doctor` is now data-driven. Migration maps can declare `replay-until: <version>` in frontmatter + a `## Doctor Actions` JSON block in the body (schema: `settings-defaults`, `settings-subkeys`, `scaffold-files`). While the running agent is below `replay-until`, doctor re-evaluates that map on every invocation and applies its actions idempotently. Once agent catches up, the map retires from the replay pass automatically. Future backfill-class migrations don't need CLI code changes — they just add the block to their map. Session-start boot path untouched; only explicit `soma doctor` runs the replay.
- **Agent Notes relocated out of `body/ecosystem.md` (SX-547, v0.21.0)** — the rolling session-observation log now lives at `memory/notes/soma-log.md` (bundled template seeds at init, doctor tier-1 soft-check backfills for upgrades via `writeIfMissing`). `body/ecosystem.md` shrank from 33KB/322 lines to 10KB/174 lines and is now `lazy: true` so its content no longer hits the cached prefix on every boot. Expected cacheWrite savings: ~5.5K tokens/boot (~25%).
- **Recent Ancestry auto-injected into preload (SX-549)** — last N entries from `memory/notes/soma-log.md` inject as `## Recent Ancestry` in the preload user-message on fresh boot. Configured via `settings.preload.recentNotesCount` (default 3; set 0 to disable). User-message injection only; does not affect the cached system prompt. Graceful no-op if `memory/notes/soma-log.md` is missing.
- **Children monitor promoted to bundled scripts (SX-557 follow-up)** — `soma children list/tail/kill/focus/watch` + new `soma children spawn <role> "<task>"` now ship via `repos/agent/scripts/` (was workspace-only). Shell-spawned children register themselves in `~/.soma/state/children.json` so the shipped `children` Pi tool and the CLI dashboard share the same registry. Hex IDs (`child-xxxxxx`) match the SX-553 shape. tmux default driver, cmux optional when available.
- **Doctor tier-1 soft-check for v0.21.0 structural pieces** — pre-0.21.0 users never received the backfilled migration chain, so `addIfMissing` + a new `scaffoldMemoryNotes` check run on every boot. Missing `memory/notes/soma-log.md` gets scaffolded from the bundled template (writeIfMissing, never clobbers). Tier-2 (agent-driven) handles `body/_memory.md` customization review via the migration map's `agent-prompt`.
- **Crystallize Phase A: `soma new muscle` / `soma new protocol` + templates (SX-559)** — lowers the friction of creating new muscles or protocols. Scaffolds the file at the right location (`.soma/amps/muscles/<name>.md` or `--global` for `~/.soma/...`) from a canonical template with frontmatter pre-filled (created date, session origin, author, description, triggers). Idempotent — re-running on an existing name opens it in `$EDITOR` instead of clobbering. Templates live at `templates/default/_muscle-template.md` + `_protocol-template.md` as single source of truth for frontmatter conventions. Addresses the "she'll see patterns but won't crystallize them because the ceremony is too high" gap. Phase B (the `crystallize` Pi tool) + Phase C (idempotent update semantics) scoped in `releases/v0.20.x/plans/crystallize/README.md`.
- **Discoverability: `soma tool` CLI + `capabilities` Pi tool (SX-558)** — two surfaces to introspect Soma's tool registry without re-reading the whole system prompt. `soma tool` (no args) lists every registered tool with a one-liner; `soma tool <name>` prints the full authored guidance (description, promptSnippet, promptGuidelines, parameters). Runs offline via static parse of `extensions/*.ts` — no session needed. For the runtime view (post-`_tools.md` overrides), a new `capabilities` Pi tool with `op:'list'` and `op:'detail'` does the same thing from inside a session. Closes the "`soma delegate --help` does nothing" gap. Bundled docs at `docs/tools.md#discovering-whats-registered` and `docs/commands.md`.
- **Lazy-loaded body files (SX-548)** — body files with `lazy: true` in frontmatter now contribute only their `description` field to the cached system prompt. Full content loaded on demand via the `read` tool. Opt-in per file; missing flag preserves existing behavior. Enables Tier 2 loading for volatile files (ecosystem.md Agent Notes, journal.md index) with a one-line config change. Expected cacheWrite savings: ~5K tokens per boot when applied to ecosystem + journal.
- **Project `core_rules.md` additions (SX-555)** — projects can now place a `body/core_rules.md` in their `.soma/` directory; content is appended after the agent-shipped `system-core.md` rather than replacing it. Shipped rules cannot be accidentally removed by a project override. Missing file = identical behavior to pre-0.20.4.
- **`delegate(background:true)` + `children` tool (SX-553 Phase A)** — `delegate` now accepts `background:true` to spawn a child soma in a new cmux pane and return a handle immediately (`{childId, pane, surface, status}`) instead of blocking. New `children` Pi tool with `op:"list"` reads `~/.soma/state/children.json` and formats a status table (id, role, model, status, cost, runtime, pane). Atomic-rename IO helpers (`appendChild`, `updateChild`, `readChildrenJson`, `writeChildrenJson`). Backward-compat: omitting `background` preserves existing synchronous behavior. Phase B (tail/steer/kill/harvest) + Phase C (ghostty/tmux drivers) pending.
- **`cache.retention` setting (SX-544 Phase A)** — new settings schema `cache: { retention: 'long' | 'short' | 'none' | null }`. When set to `"long"`, soma-boot injects `PI_CACHE_RETENTION=long` for Pi's provider layer, enabling 1-hour Anthropic prompt cache TTL (2× write cost, break-even at one re-hit within 60m). Default `null` = inherit shell env or Pi default (5m). Doctor migration adds the key to existing `settings.json`. No behavior change until user opts in. Phase B (validation) + Phase C (keepalive coupling) still pending.
- **soma-deploy.sh — thin wrapper on Dokploy API**
- **browserCdpHost + browserCdpUrl — browser can live anywhere**
- **browser profile tokenization — userDataDir + profileDirectory**
- **Endpoint resolver (SX-513, s01-6d05dd)** — single source of truth for every URL the agent touches. Tier 2 extensions (`bridge-connect`, `workspace-tools`) + dev scripts (`launch-browser`) now route through `_shared/env.ts` (Node side) + `soma-env.sh` (bash side). Mode taxonomy: `local` / `cloud` / `pro` / `enterprise` / `auto`. User default `cloud`; our dev default `auto` (probes localhost:18800, falls back to cloud). Config lives under `environment` in `settings.json` and is only read by the dev extension — prod has endpoints baked at build time.
- **`bridge-connect-dev.ts`** — dev-only sibling of the shipped `bridge-connect.ts`. Reads `environment.mode` + overrides live, exposes a new `env_status` tool for runtime diagnostics. Installed via `soma-dev symlink extensions --dev`.
- **`soma-env.sh`** — pure-bash resolver helper (no node dep, no cold start). Mirrors env.ts's defaults table. Parity guarded by `test-env-resolver-parity.sh` so the two implementations can't drift.
- **`environment` block in `SomaSettings` interface** (`core/settings.ts`) — typed config for future agent-side `soma env` CLI; dev extensions read it today, prod extensions ignore it.
- **Three new test suites** (`tests/test-env-resolver.sh`, `test-env-resolver-parity.sh`, `test-no-hardcoded-endpoints.sh`) — 25 + 24 + 4 assertions covering resolver behavior, shell/TS parity, and a golden-rule guard that catches any regression back to literal endpoints in migrated Tier 2 files.
- **`SOMA_PROJECT_DIR` env var exported to discovered scripts (SX-555)** — when `soma <cmd>` dispatches to a discovered script (bundled / project / global), it now walks up from `$PWD` to find the nearest `.soma/` directory and exports the path as `SOMA_PROJECT_DIR`. Scripts can trust the env var instead of recomputing from `$0` (which breaks for bundled scripts living far from the user's project). Paired with the `resolve_soma_dir` helpers in `soma-refactor.sh` / `soma-seam.sh`.
- **`soma update --yes` / `-y`** — skip the Y/N confirmation prompt in scripted upgrades. Closes the documented one-liner `npm install -g meetsoma@latest && soma update --yes`. Surfaced during the s01-c6944c CLI audit (post-v0.20.3 follow-up).

### Fixed
- **ship .py helpers + _lib/ alongside .sh scripts**
- **comprehensive settings backfill + Pro auth scaffold + upgrade test**
- **add digest blocks to 3 bundled muscles (SX-563)**
- **run tier-1 soft-check unconditionally**
- **resolve soma_dir correctly + bash 3.2 compat + honest stable error**
- **`soma refactor` / `soma seam` now resolve the right project directory when run outside cwd (SX-555)** — both scripts previously computed `SOMA_DIR` relative to their own install location, which broke for users whose project `.soma/` wasn't a sibling of the script. Added `resolve_soma_dir` helper that prefers `$SOMA_PROJECT_DIR`, then walks up from `$PWD`, then falls back to the legacy relative path. Also handles SIGPIPE gracefully (was killing piped output).
- **`soma plans` bash 3.2 compat restored (SX-555)** — the `overlap` command used `declare -A` (associative arrays), which macOS bash 3.2 doesn't support. Rewrote to emit topic/path tuples to a tempfile, sort, and group — portable across bash versions. `get_field` now returns `|| true` so missing frontmatter fields don't trip `pipefail`.
- **`soma-install.sh stable` gives an honest error (SX-555)** — `repos/agent-stable` was retired s01-419457 in favor of git tags. Stable mode now prints an explanation and points to the tag-based-install plan instead of failing silently.
- **extractTldr no longer truncates multi-line TL;DRs**
- **`symlink-extensions.sh` used stale post-restructure path** — was pointing at `somaverse/extensions/` (moved to `somaverse/builds/local/extensions/` in s01-efe898). Updated + added `--dev` flag that swaps the bridge-connect symlink to the dev variant.
- **`build.sh` auth-gate temp files broke relative imports** — temps were written to `/tmp/` so esbuild couldn't resolve `./_shared/env.js`. Moved temps next to sources.

## [0.20.3] — 2026-04-20

Patch release. Cache-stickiness: `/reload` no longer invalidates the
Anthropic prompt cache. The compiled system prompt is persisted to
`.soma/state/.session-prompt-cache.json` and restored across
reload/resume/fork. A new `/rebuild` command forces explicit recompile
when body edits should be picked up.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`/rebuild` command (SX-495)** — forces recompile of the system prompt and deletes the disk cache. Optional — only run it if you've edited `body/*.md` mid-session AND you want the change to apply right now. Otherwise `/reload` keeps the prompt sticky and body edits land naturally on your next session.
- **Disk-backed prompt cache (SX-495)** — `.soma/state/.session-prompt-cache.json` written on first compile, restored on subsequent reloads. Eliminates the ~$1 cache-invalidation cost per `/reload`.
- **Severity-aware change indicator on statusline line 3** — replaced the intrusive "Changes detected" toast with a subtle third-line tag. Labels: `🔄 /reload` (extensions/*.ts + core/*.ts; picked up by jiti re-import — confirmed in Pi's `extensions.md`), `📝 /rebuild?` (body/*.md — the `?` denotes optional), `⚠ relaunch` (dist/* or core/*.js — Pi's static imports are frozen at process boot, `/reload` can't help; `/exit` and run `soma` again). Signal writer + reader updated; legacy `severity: restart` still read for back-compat. Parser handles both YAML and JSON payloads (SX-497 will unify writers).
- **Commands doc — Reload & Rebuild section** (`docs/commands.md`) — explains the two commands, when to use each, and what the statusline indicators mean.

### Fixed
- **Tier 2 extension build path updated for somaverse restructure** — `build-extensions/build.sh` SOMAVERSE_EXT now points to `somaverse/builds/local/extensions/` (moved s01-efe898). Unblocked v0.20.3 dry-run.
- **`soma focus` restored.** Was silently broken since the Pro-scripts refactor moved `soma-seam.sh` into `scripts/_pro/` (and released form renamed to `.js`). `soma-focus.sh` only looked for `scripts/soma-seam.sh` and always errored. Now searches `scripts/`, `scripts/_pro/`, `$SOMA_DIR/amps/scripts/`, `~/.soma/amps/scripts/` and dispatches `node` for `.js` / `bash` for `.sh`. End-to-end verified.
- **`docs/focus.md` accuracy.** Scoring table, force-include threshold, and heat formula were all out of date. Corrected to match `core/muscles.ts:matchMusclesToFocus` — trigger/keywords/topic list match (10), name (3), digest (2); force-include at `>= 8`; heat = `score + 2`; tags don't participate.
- **`soma-dev sync-docs` walks subdirs.** `docs/guides/` was missing from the website; bash 3.2-compatible explicit loop added.

- **`/reload` no longer invalidates Anthropic prompt cache (SX-495)** — previously, re-importing `soma-boot` reset `compiledSystemPrompt` to null; next turn recompiled from disk and re-sealed a fresh cache, forcing a miss. Now `tryRestoreCompiledPrompt()` rehydrates from disk when `session_start.reason ∈ {reload, resume, fork}`. Fresh launches (`reason=startup|new`) still compile from scratch. `invalidateCompiledPrompt()` also unlinks the cache file (called by `/pin` and `/kill`).

### Plan
- `.soma/releases/v0.20.x/plans/cache-stickiness.md` — full audit + fix spec + acceptance criteria.

---

## [0.20.2.1] — 2026-04-19

Patch release. Closes the `_mind.md` template orphan, adds the Soma tool
registry with `_tools.md` configuration, documents tools + extension
plumbing, softens the restart alert. Three Soma tools added (`context_status`,
`file_outline`, `search`). Four script-UX no-flag fixes. CLI version label
corrected in dev mode.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Soma tool registry** (`core/tool-registry.ts`) with `somaRegisterTool()` helper — the man-in-the-middle between extension-defined tools and Pi's registry. Preserves `promptSnippet` + `promptGuidelines` in the compiled system prompt (Pi's `ToolInfo` strips them).
- **`_tools.md` configuration** (project → parent → global body chain). Sections: **Disabled** (opt-out list), **Overrides** (per-tool field tweaks), **Custom** (parsed; registration lands v0.20.3). Hardwired set (`delegate`) cannot be disabled.
- **`context_status` tool** — returns `{percent, tokens, contextWindow}` so the agent can ground its runway decisions instead of estimating.
- **`file_outline` tool** — markdown/text headings with line numbers. 10–15× cheaper than full-file reads for orientation.
- **`search` tool (MVP)** — unified search with pluggable backends. Default: ripgrep over cwd, respects `.gitignore`. `scope="api"` uses Brave Search when `BRAVE_API_KEY` or `SOMA_SEARCH_API_KEY` is set. `scope="semantic"` deferred to v0.20.3.1.
- **`docs/tools.md`** (new) — Soma tools reference: three registration routes, `_tools.md` format, sub-agent scoping, bundled set, invocation vs prompt registries.
- **`docs/extending.md`** additions: `pi.registerTool` + `pi.getActiveTools` + `pi.getAllTools` in API table; hot-reload notes; "Modifying the System Prompt" section; full **Soma Tools** section (writing a tool with `somaRegisterTool`, comparison table vs `pi.registerTool`); **External tool → Soma bridge (the inbox)** section documenting the drop-in CLI integration (token, allowlist, JSON format).
- `body/_tools.md` seeded in meetsoma + bundled `templates/default/_tools.md`.
- Refactor breadcrumbs at top of `extensions/soma-boot.ts` — clean-break candidates noted (~3700 LOC file) for a future refactor session.

### Fixed
- **Tool-registry timing fix (`37106e0`)** — `_tools.md` disable/override rules now apply at extension-load time. Pi loads extensions (calling `somaRegisterTool`) BEFORE firing `session_start`, so the previous `setToolConfigChain()` call ran too late. Fix: lazy chain self-discovery in `getToolConfig()` — walks up from `process.cwd()` if no explicit chain is set. 6 new timing tests added (62/62 total passing, was 56).

- **`_mind.md` was orphaned** since Phase 1c.1 (`s01-a1a6aa`). The Pi-native shortcut returned `event.systemPrompt` unchanged when `SYSTEM.md` + `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` existed, bypassing the template compiler. User customizations to `body/_mind.md` had no effect. The shortcut is removed. `compileFullSystemPrompt` (template-driven via `compileWithTemplate`) is now the single path. `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` writes redirect to `.soma/state/` as introspection artifacts; Pi no longer auto-discovers them.
- **`soma --version`** in dev mode showed runtime v0.20.2 instead of CLI v0.3.5. `npm/thin-cli.js` read `__dirname/../package.json`, which resolved to agent's package.json in dev-symlink installs. Esbuild `--define:__CLI_VERSION__` + `build-dist.mjs` string-substitution now inject the correct literal.
- **Restart alert too aggressive.** Pi `/reload` hot-reloads extensions via `jiti.import` (mtime-keyed cache) — `extensions/*.ts` edits don't need a full process restart. `.git-hooks/post-commit` now classifies changed files: `extensions/*.ts` and `core/*.ts` → `severity=reload`; `core/*.js` and `dist/*` → `severity=restart`. `soma-statusline` reads severity and shows the matching message.
- **Script no-flag UX (SX-490):** `soma-login` no longer starts OAuth without an explicit `start` subcommand. `soma-snapshot` no longer snapshots CWD without an explicit path — bare invocation prints help + recent snapshots. `soma-theme` now prints help when executed directly (still sources cleanly). `git-identity-hook` unchanged (silent exit-0 is correct for a git hook).

### Changed
- `somaRegisterTool` replaces `pi.registerTool` across all Soma bundled tool files (`soma-delegate`, `soma-code-tools`, `soma-context`, `soma-search`). Third-party extensions using `pi.registerTool` directly still work; tools just render with description-only (no per-tool `promptSnippet`/`promptGuidelines`).
- `buildToolSection` accepts an optional `somaTools` registry. When present, rendered output includes per-tool guideline bullets prefixed `[tool_name]`.
- `.git-hooks/` now tracked in git (was gitignored under a non-existent "generator"). Install path unchanged: `git config core.hooksPath .git-hooks`.

### Docs
- New `docs/tools.md`.
- Substantial `docs/extending.md` expansion (tools, inbox, system-prompt hook, hot-reload).

### Deferred / parked for v0.20.3
- Full deletion of `compileFullSystemPrompt` + `extractSections` + `buildToolSection` legacy helpers (reversed this session — the compiler is staying; `_mind.md` drives the prompt).
- Custom markdown-defined tools (`_tools.md` **Custom** section) — shell execution + security model.
- Multi-provider search backends (tavily, exa, perplexity).
- Local-semantic search backend + `soma index` command.
- Audit-token release tool.
- Upstream ask to Mario re: exposing `promptSnippet`/`promptGuidelines` on `ToolInfo`.

## [0.20.2] — 2026-04-18

The v0.20.3 prompt refactor arc. Moves Soma from "replace Pi's prompt wholesale"
(compileFullSystemPrompt rebuild path) to "let Pi compile; we augment" (SYSTEM.md
+ APPEND_SYSTEM.md via Pi's native auto-discovery). Option B from the REFACTOR-PLAN.
Also: 5 script-backed Pi tools, a pretest CLI, and two version-check bug fixes.

Pi-native mode is now DEFAULT when SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md exist. Escape
hatch: `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT=1` forces the old full-replacement path. Kept alive
until Phase 1c.2 (planned deletion of ~300 LOC rebuild path).

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **smarter randomizer + version-aware skeletons + CLI integration**
- **three-layer version snapshot + update check (SX-489)**

**Phase 1a/1b — SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md auto-discovery pipeline:**
- `compileSystemMd(options)` + `writeSystemMd(options)` in `core/prompt.ts`. Compiles
  identity-only content (soul + voice + body + ecosystem + core_rules) to
  `<somaPath>/SYSTEM.md`. Pi auto-discovers via
  `resource-loader.js:660 discoverSystemPromptFile()` and uses as `customPrompt`.
- `compileAppendSystemMd(options)` + `writeAppendSystemMd(options)` in `core/prompt.ts`.
  Compiles AMPS + tools + guard + docs to `<somaPath>/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. Pi auto-discovers
  via `resource-loader.js:671 discoverAppendSystemPromptFile()` and uses as `appendSystemPrompt`.
- Writers wired in `extensions/soma-boot.ts`: `writeSystemMd` at `session_start`,
  `writeAppendSystemMd` at `before_agent_start` (eagerly, before path split, so both
  Pi-native and legacy paths keep APPEND current).
- `SYSTEM_MD_FALLBACKS` constant: minimum-viable Soma-voice prose for empty soul/voice/body/
  core_rules. Keeps SYSTEM.md coherent in fresh-install directories.

**Phase 1c.1 — Pi-native as default:**
- `before_agent_start` now defaults to Pi-native when SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md exist.
- Legacy opt-out via `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT=1`. First-run safety: missing files → legacy path
  runs, seeds files for session N+1.

**Phase 1d — XML tag experiment (Anthropic-style adherence aid):**
- `<rules>` tag around core_rules in SYSTEM.md output (first behavioral tag in our
  compiled prompt — previously we had only Pi's native `<available_skills>`).
- `<behavioral_rules>` + `<tool_guidance>` tags in APPEND_SYSTEM.md. Matches Anthropic's
  own prompt conventions (Sonnet 4.5 → 4.6 doubled tag count; we were at 1).

**Phase 2 — 5 script-backed Pi tools (`extensions/soma-code-tools.ts`):**
- `code_find` — grep with file:line:match output, respects .gitignore (cap 500)
- `code_map` — function/class/method index for a file
- `code_refs` — symbol references classified as DEF / USE / IMP (run before renaming)
- `code_structure` — directory tree with file sizes, max depth 3
- `code_blast` — blast radius: all files touching a symbol with severity (run before deleting)
- All `executionMode: "parallel"` (read-only, safe concurrent), ANSI colors stripped,
  output capped with helpful refinement hints when truncated.
- `promptSnippet` + `promptGuidelines` populated on all 5 so Pi surfaces them in the
  "Available tools:" / "Guidelines:" prose (first effect visible post Phase 1c.1).

**`soma preview` — pretest CLI (`scripts/soma-preview.{sh,ts}`):**
- Compiles SYSTEM.md + APPEND_SYSTEM.md from live body files without a sandbox restart.
- Flags: `--out <dir>`, `--system-only`, `--append-only`, `--quiet`, `--diff`, `--help`.
- `--diff` compares fresh compile against on-disk files with byte deltas and staleness.
- Runs outside the TUI. No API cost.
- Distinct from `scripts/prompt-preview.ts` (fixtures-based scenarios for testing).

### Fixed
- **cap items per version (highlights only, not full changelog)**
- **pi-agent keyword false-positive on public package**
- **auto-advance workspace marker when no migration is pending**

- **`soma update` false positive on dev versions.** The CLI update check used string
  comparison (`latest > VERSION`) which made `"0.3.4" > "0.20.1.1"` true (`'3' > '2'`
  lexically). Dev users on 0.20.x were told to "update" to stable 0.3.x — which is older.
  Fix: use `semverCmp()` (already defined in the module, just not called here).
  Applied to both `repos/agent/npm/thin-cli.js` and `repos/agent-2x/npm/thin-cli.js`.
- **`npm install -g meetsoma` EEXIST on dev installs.** When `soma` bin is a manual
  symlink to `repos/agent/dist/cli.js` (typical dev setup via `soma-install.sh dev`),
  npm refuses to overwrite the unowned file. Fix: `detectDevInstall()` reads the bin's
  symlink target and, when it's not an npm-managed path, guides to
  `soma-install.sh stable` first before `npm install -g meetsoma`.
- **`delegate` tool invisible in Pi's "Available tools:" prose.** Pi intentionally omits
  custom tools when `promptSnippet` is absent (per `ToolDefinition` contract at
  `types.d.ts:289`). Added `promptSnippet` + `promptGuidelines` to `soma-delegate.ts`.
  Previously unobservable because our rebuild path stripped the section entirely;
  became visible after Phase 1c.1 landed.
- **APPEND_SYSTEM.md went stale between sessions.** Was only refreshed inside the legacy
  branch — Pi-native sessions never rewrote it even when body files or heat changed.
  Moved `writeAppendSystemMd` to run BEFORE the path split so both paths keep APPEND current.

### Changed

- `before_agent_start` restructured: APPEND refresh happens eagerly, path selection
  (Pi-native vs legacy) happens after. Escape hatch env var renamed from
  `SOMA_PI_NATIVE_PROMPT` (opt-in gate, Phase 1b Commit 3) to `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT`
  (opt-out gate, Phase 1c.1) as the default flipped.
- `compileSystemMd` source comment stamp bumped: `Phase 1a` → `Phase 1d` (tag adoption).
- `compileAppendSystemMd` source comment stamp bumped: `Phase 1b` → `Phase 1d`.

### Notes

- **Sandbox verified end-to-end** (session `s01-5c01df`): Pi-native path active,
  APPEND content visible in system prompt including Behavioral Rules, Muscle Memory,
  Tools section with all 6 tools (read, bash, edit, write, code_find, code_map,
  code_refs, code_structure, code_blast, delegate), and Tool Guidelines. Model
  naturally preferred `code_find` over `bash('soma code find ...')` — typed-tool
  adherence signal positive.
- **Phase 1c.2 deliberately deferred.** Deleting ~300 LOC of `compileFullSystemPrompt`
  + `extractSections` + `buildToolSection` + `BUILTIN_TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS` + helpers is
  the next step after one real session of Pi-native-default observation. Bisectable
  single commit when it lands.
- **Tag experiment signal pending.** `_mind.md` tags affect the legacy path (still
  reachable via `SOMA_LEGACY_PROMPT=1`). New-path tags are in place. The real
  adherence delta measurement requires parent meetsoma session-level observation.

## [0.20.1.1] — 2026-04-18

Role expansion + curator polish. Closes the Phase-2 delegation arc: the
curator can now run apply inline (opt-in), pending gaps flow to a
human-editable scratchpad, and roles can declare where their canonical
file lives (source-of-truth) + where artifacts go (paths block).

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Three more roles**: `planner` (writes plan files, `[read, bash, write]`), `doc_writer` (markdown-only edits, `[read, edit, write]`), `reflector` (journal entries under `memory/journal/`, `[read, write]`). 7 roles total. Researcher deferred to v0.20.2 pending search integration.
- **`source-of-truth` frontmatter field** on roles. Project-root-relative or absolute path to the canonical role file. When set, `discoverRole` re-reads from there and `apply` writes amendments there — fixes the runtime-copy vs git-source drift v0.20.1 highlighted. Missing file → stderr warning + fallback to chain-walked copy.
- **`paths:` frontmatter block** on roles. Per-role artifact paths (`invocations`, `proposals`, `proposalsApplied`, `scratchpad`) with `{role}` templating. Absent block = hardcoded defaults (zero migration). All paths live under `memory/` so writes stay cache-safe.
- **`--auto-apply` flag** on `soma-dev children curate`. When set, auto-apply-class proposals apply inline during curate (one command for the round trip). Default OFF — proposals stay in `proposals/` for human review.
- **Scratchpad** (`memory/children/<role>/scratchpad.md`). When `--auto-apply` is off, auto-apply-class findings still write proposals AND append dated sections to the scratchpad so pending gaps are visible at a glance. Append-only; human-editable.
- **`applyProposal`** exported from `core/delegate-core.ts` as a library function. CLI stub is a thin wrapper now. `curateRole` calls it directly under `--auto-apply`. Returns structured `ApplyProposalResult` with 8 reason codes.
- **`resolveRolePaths(role, somaDir, roleDef?)`** — single source of truth for per-role artifact paths. Threaded through `logInvocation`, `scanMLRQueue`, `writeProposal`, `hasProposalBeenApplied`, and `applyProposal`.

### Fixed
- **Classifier false-positive on `what_worked` entries.** An MLR observation like `what_worked: ['Task completed within budget']` matched the config-keyword regex for `budget` and produced a bogus propose-class amendment. `inferAmendmentSection` now short-circuits on `sourceField === 'what_worked'` and routes to `accumulated_knowledge` unconditionally — success reports are observations, not config changes.

### Changed
- `curateRole` signature extends with `opts?: { autoApply?: boolean }` (back-compat default false). Returns extended `CurateResult` with `applied` array and `scratchpadAppended` count.
- `buildProposal` now accepts `roleDef` to avoid redundant `discoverRole` I/O.

### Cache-safety confirmed
`core/body.ts:628-648` iterates `readdirSync(bodyDir)` filtering `.endsWith(".md")` — directories (incl. `body/children/`) are skipped. Role edits don't invalidate parent cache. All new artifacts (scratchpad, proposals, invocations) live under `memory/` which is likewise not walked. Verified empirically: source-of-truth writes to canonical `body/children/verifier.md` completed without cache storm.

---

## [0.20.0.1] — 2026-04-18

Delegation hardening. v0.20.0 shipped the MVP; v0.20.0.1 makes it production-shaped:
model fallback chain (free-tier friendly), per-invocation health cache + cooldown,
MLR parsed into structured objects, cost/token tracking, and CLI paths (`children run`,
`children health`) for driving delegations outside the TUI.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Structured model chain in role frontmatter** (`model-chain:` list of entries with `id`, `class`, `cooldown-on-rate-limit`). Scalar `default-model: <id>` still works (1-entry chain back-compat).
- **Model policies** (`model-policy:` — `order` | `free-only` | `paid-only` | `prefer-free`). Runtime walks the chain per-policy, skipping unavailable or cooldown'd models.
- **Health cache + cooldown** at `.soma/state/model-health.json`. Rate-limited or dead models get marked and skipped for a TTL (default 1h). Survives across sessions.
- **MLR (Memory-Lane-Reflection) yaml parsing** on child final messages. Observations flow to `inv.mlr.{what_worked, what_struggled, missing_capability, suggested_amendments, map_issues}` in `memory/children/<role>/invocations.jsonl`. Foundation for v0.20.1's curator loop.
- **Cost + token tracking** per attempt (`inv.cost_usd`, `inv.tokens_input`, `inv.tokens_output`). Attempts array records each model tried in the chain.
- **`soma-dev children run <role> "<task>"`** — CLI stub that invokes `runDelegation` outside the TUI. Useful for dev regression + batch testing.
- **`soma-dev children health <role>`** — shows chain with per-model class, resolvable state, cooldown, filtered (per policy). Diagnostic for "why is my child using sonnet when I declared a chain?"

### Changed
- **`extensions/soma-delegate.ts` refactored to thin wrapper** (~50 lines) over `core/delegate-core.ts` (~800 lines at v0.20.0.1). Logic lives in core; extension just registers the Pi tool. Enables CLI stubs to call `runDelegation` without Pi's extension harness.
- `loadAgentClass` is now async (dual-strategy: `createRequire` for CJS, dynamic `import()` for ESM). Callers must `await`.

### Fixed
- **Free-tier rate limits (429/503) on `openrouter/*:free` models**. v0.20.0's hardcoded Haiku default was a workaround; v0.20.0.1's chain-walking is the real fix. Role can declare a free-first chain and fall through to paid-cheap on rate limit.

### Sandbox-verified (5 cases)
T1 scalar back-compat, T3 chain gemma→qwen→haiku fall-through, T4 cooldown skip, T6 MLR parsed into structured object, T7 cost $0.0044 / 2819+313 tokens.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-04-18

**Delegation MVP. Team Soma begins.** The `delegate` Pi tool spawns an in-process child agent via `pi-agent-core.Agent`, running a role-tuned system prompt while inheriting parent soul/voice/ecosystem. Foundation for everything in v0.20.x.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`delegate` tool** (registered via `extensions/soma-delegate.ts`). Called as `delegate(task, role?, model?)`. Spawns `pi-agent-core.Agent` in-process, tool budget enforced (`max-tool-calls`), returns summary + cost + MLR.
- **Role files** in `body/children/`: `_child.md` (sub-compiler template), `_child-template.md` (scaffold for new roles), `general.md` (starter role: Sonnet, full tools, budget 25/$0.25).
- **Role discovery via body chain.** `discoverRole` walks `body/children/<role>.md` across the soma chain (project → parent → global) so a workspace can ship roles its child projects inherit.
- **Prompt compilation** for children. Compact soul (1500 chars) + voice (1000) + ecosystem (2000) + role identity + role accumulated knowledge + task. Haiku by default so cost stays tight.
- **`soma-dev children` CLI** (new subcommand group). `list` / `show` / `add` / `edit` / `stats` / `tail` / `validate` for inspecting + managing roles and their invocation logs.
- **Invocation log** at `memory/children/<role>/invocations.jsonl`. Append-only JSONL per role: timestamp, model, tool calls, duration, cost, summary.
- **`pi-agent-core`** added as direct dependency (was transitive). Uses its `Agent` class as the child-spawning primitive.
- **Sandbox architecture** — persistent `~/soma-2x-sandbox/` folder (her filesystem) + dedicated `~/.soma-2x/agent/` install (runtime symlinks to `repos/agent-2x/`, auth/settings shared from main install). Keeps parent session's `~/.soma/agent/` untouched during iteration.
- **`soma-2x-cmux.sh`** launcher. Opens a cmux workspace with Sonnet parent + invocation-monitor pane. `--focus` / `--close` / `--restart` flags for iteration cycle.

### Fixed (during MVP verification, same release cycle)
- **`pi-agent-core.Agent` via `createRequire` bypass.** Pi's extension loader aliases `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` and can resolve to wrong package under jiti. Switched to `createRequire(import.meta.url)` for that one import — native Node resolution bypasses jiti. `pi-ai` + `pi-coding-agent` stay ESM-only (static imports at module top).
- **Inline flow YAML arrays.** `inherits: []` was parsed as the string `"[]"`; parser now detects and splits `[a, b, c]` inline.
- **Inline YAML comments.** `default-model: claude-sonnet-4-5  # comment` previously included the comment in the value. `stripComment` handles this now (respects `#` inside quoted strings).
- **`getModel` returning `undefined`** (not throwing) when a model id was unknown. Now surfaces as a typed error the chain walker can react to.
- **OpenRouter Claude models** — wired provider + normalized id forms; `openrouter/google/gemma-4-31b-it:free` resolves correctly now.

### Notes
- Not tagged as a discrete release; delegation MVP was sandbox-internal on `dev-2x` and consolidated under the v0.20.1 tag when the curator loop landed. This entry backfills the history.

---

## [0.20.1] — 2026-04-18

Curator loop + specialized child roles (verifier, builder, curator). Closes the self-improvement cycle: delegation observations (MLR) → classifier → proposal files → human-apply → role.md amended.

> Shipped on `dev-2x` branch. Merged to `dev` at tag time. Follows v0.20.0 (delegation MVP) + v0.20.0.1 (delegation hardening).

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Three role files** in `body/children/`: `verifier.md` (read-only, `read + bash`, PASS/FAIL + evidence), `builder.md` (write-capable, `read + bash + edit + write`, bounded edits with verify-after), `curator.md` (meta-role, `read + write`, proposes amendments). All bound to `claude-haiku-4-5` by default with per-role budgets.
- **MLR queue reader** `scanMLRQueue(role, somaDir, sinceTs?)` in `core/delegate-core.ts`. Scans `memory/children/<role>/invocations.jsonl`, flattens `mlr.{what_worked, what_struggled, missing_capability, suggested_amendments}` into structured amendment candidates.
- **Amendment classifier** `classifyAmendment(entry, evidence)` returns `auto-apply` | `propose` | `human-only` | `skip`. Auto-apply requires `accumulated_knowledge` section + ≥2 distinct invocations + text < 200 chars. `default-tools`/`budget`/`success_criteria` → `propose`. Identity/soul/voice/inherits → `human-only`.
- **Proposal writer** `writeProposal` emits `memory/children/<role>/proposals/<id>.md` with frontmatter (id, role, class, section, evidence) + body (amendment, reason, apply command).
- **`soma-dev children mlr [<role>]`** — scan MLR queue, table output (ts, source, section, text).
- **`soma-dev children curate [<role>]`** — classify queue → write proposals. Summary by class (auto-apply / propose / human-only).
- **`soma-dev children apply <proposal-id> [--force]`** — append amendment to role.md section, archive to `proposals/_applied/`. Auto-apply default; `--force` for propose-class (v0.20.1 still gates non-`accumulated_knowledge` sections).
- **Chain-walk in `children.sh`** (SX-482). Port of `core/discovery.ts:getSomaChain` to bash. Shell subcommands now resolve roles across the full soma chain (project → parent → global `~/.soma`), matching runtime behavior. Adds per-role `source` column in `list` (project/parent/global) and `--soma=<path>` pin flag.
- **Dedup in curator flow** (SX-481 fixup). `hasAmendmentInRole` + `hasProposalBeenApplied` helpers prevent duplicate bullets when curator runs on different days (slug-based dedup includes date, so same text on new day previously slipped through). Applied at both `buildProposal` (skip before write) and `apply-proposal` (skip + archive-only, defense in depth).
- **`resolveTools` honors `bash` in read-only roles** (s01-b420d5 fix). `createReadOnlyTools()` upstream returns `[Read, Grep, Find, Ls]` with no Bash; `resolveTools` was dropping the `bash` declaration for any role without edit/write. Now rebuilt declaratively from 7 individual constructors so `[read, bash]` resolves correctly.

### Changed
- `buildProposal` signature: optional `cwd` + `somaDirPath` params so library callers can thread the caller's chain into role discovery (instead of relying on `process.cwd()`).
- `curateRole` signature: optional `cwd` param threaded to `buildProposal`.
- `children list` output includes a `SOURCE` column (project/parent/global).

### Deferred to v0.20.1.1 / v0.20.2
- Remaining 4 roles: planner, doc_writer, researcher, reflector.
- Path-gated `edit` tool for curator (direct role.md edits without proposal round-trip).
- Direct auto-apply during curator run (today: curator writes proposals, human runs `apply`).
- `source-of-truth` frontmatter field — route amendments to git-canonical path, not chain-walk result (SX-483, v0.20.2).
- `soma-dev children audit` — diff runtime copies vs git source, merge in either direction (SX-484, v0.20.2).

---

## [0.12.4] — 2026-04-18

Follow-up to v0.12.3 shipping integrity. Pi runtime bump, thin-CLI UX cleanup, release-flow parity (dev ↔ main auto-sync), and a script pipefail fix.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime 0.67.6 → 0.67.68** — 2 upstream releases. Network connection retry (#3317), stable date format in system prompts (#2814), scoped-models Alt+Up/Down fix (#3331), `afterToolCall` error forwarding (#3051, #3084), git update notification reliability (#3027). New: Bedrock bearer-token auth, prompt template `argument-hint` frontmatter, `after_provider_response` extension hook, OSC 8 hyperlink rendering.
- **Release script auto-syncs `agent-stable`/main.** `soma-release.sh` now squash-merges `dev → agent-stable/main` after building soma-beta and tags both branches. Prevents the drift where agent-stable fell a full release behind dev (the v0.12.2 → v0.12.3 gap that this release closes).

### Fixed
- **Thin-CLI `update` / `check-updates` / `status` now guard on `isInstalled()`.** Previously these commands assumed `~/.soma/agent/` existed and crashed unhelpfully on a fresh global install before `soma init`. Now they show a clear "not installed — run `soma init`" message.
- **Thin-CLI header text** — `Status` → `Update` on the update subcommand (matches what the command actually does).
- **Thin-CLI help text** — `postInstallCmds` expanded from 8 to 16 commands, covers `update`, `check-updates`, `status`, `doctor`, `health`, `focus`, `model`, `exhale`, etc.
- **Pre-versioning project guidance** — correct instructions for projects that pre-date `soma init` (no version file, but `.soma/` exists).
- **Stale `soma init` → `soma update` references** in `thin-cli.js`, `docs/updating.md`, and `docs/troubleshooting.md`. Missed during the v0.12.3 command reshuffle.
- **`check-phases.sh` pipefail crash on clean working tree.** `grep -v` returns 1 on empty input, which under `set -o pipefail` killed the script mid-run. Same bug class as `soma-plans.sh` bash 3.2 issues. Script now runs all 10 phases to completion.

### Internal
- Dropped the B2 patch attempt (`settings-manager.js` enabledModels sync). Pi #3331 fixes the upstream symptom, and the target function is minified to `.n()` in 0.67.68 — patching by name would silently fail. See `.soma/releases/v0.12.x/model-resolution-audit.md`.
- `UPSTREAM-NOTES.md` scratchpad added to `soma-dev/` for tracking changelog-worthy upstream items between Pi bumps.

## [0.12.3] — 2026-04-17

Shipping integrity release. Fixes a critical bug where `npm install -g meetsoma@0.3.3` produced a broken install (missing internal imports), and makes the update flow actually work. If you've been stuck on an older Pi runtime despite cutting newer Soma versions, this is why.

### Fixed
- **`meetsoma@0.3.3` broken npm install**. The published tarball imported from `./lib/` and `./welcome/` paths that weren't included, so every fresh `npm install -g meetsoma` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on first run. Fixed by bundling `thin-cli.js` with esbuild into a single self-contained file before publish. Has been broken since the `npm/` reorg — unnoticed because existing users had working installs from before.
- **TUI leakage from extensions**. `soma-route.ts` had `console.error` calls that leaked into the input buffer on shutdown and during security rejects. `hub-connect.ts` (somaverse) had WebSocket handshake logs that appeared mid-keystroke in the prompt. Both silenced — matches `bridge-connect.ts`'s silent pattern.
- **Silent Pi staleness in dev**. `soma-dev status` now compares `dist/` vs `node_modules/` Pi versions and flags drift (was the root cause of the "opus-4-7 missing" bug several users hit).

### Changed
- **`soma init` no longer updates the runtime.** Previously, typing `soma init` in an already-initialized project silently ran a runtime update instead of doing project work — the confusing overload is removed. `soma init` now always means "set up this project."
- **`soma update` now actually updates.** Was previously status-only (told you to run `soma init`). Now it performs the update: `git pull --ff-only` in `~/.soma/agent/` + `npm install --omit=dev` if dependencies changed.
- **Pi runtime is now locked to Soma version.** `soma-beta/package.json` pins Pi exact (was `^0.67.6`, now `0.67.6`). `soma-beta` now ships a `package-lock.json` too — users get the exact Pi dependency tree we tested against. Pi updates only when Soma cuts a new release.
- **`soma doctor` / `soma status`** now shows installed Pi runtime version and flags drift between declared and installed. Catches the class of bug where `npm install` hadn't been re-run after a Pi bump.
- **`soma check-updates`** preserves the old "report-only" behavior that `soma update` used to have, for when you just want to see what's available without updating.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Periodic update check inside the agent.** `soma-statusline.ts` runs a silent `git fetch` every 30 minutes while the agent is running. If behind, shows `⬆ update` in the statusline and writes to `~/.soma/config.json` so the next `soma` boot prints a one-line notice. Zero network latency at CLI launch.
- **Pre-publish smoke test.** `soma-npm-publish.sh` now packs the tarball, extracts it to a clean temp dir, and runs `node dist/thin-cli.js --version` before allowing npm publish. Aborts if the tarball has broken imports or contains forbidden content (`dist/core/`, `.ts`, `node_modules/`, etc.). Also integrated into `soma-dev pipeline` so dev cycles catch breakage early.
- **Docker e2e sandbox** (`soma-sandbox-docker.sh local`) now reliably tests our local bundle. Previous Dockerfile had a broken `COPY ... local-pkg*` glob that created a file literally named `local-pkg*`, so the sandbox was silently falling through to the registry version. Fixed — 24/24 tests pass in clean `node:22-slim` container.

### Internal
- `repos/agent/scripts/_dev/patches/` unchanged — only `error-sanitizer` remains. An attempt to add a `settings-manager-enabled-models` patch was rolled back when it turned out not to be necessary (speculation from an inbox report; the actual user bug was update-flow staleness, not Ctrl+P cycling).
- New muscles: `inbox-handling.md` (inbox letters are diagnoses, not FYIs), `tui-safe-logging.md` (no bare `console.*` in extensions).
- New soma-dev-map phase entry: Phase 0 orient now checks Pi drift (`soma-dev status`) and scans inbox as part of orientation.

---

## [0.12.2] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`soma model` command** — Switch your default model from the CLI. Fuzzy matching (`soma model opus`), interactive selection when multiple matches, persistent save to settings. Subcommands: `soma model <pattern> set` (save without starting), `soma model <pattern> start` (save + start session), `soma model --list [search]` (browse models).
- **Claude Opus 4.7 support** — Available via `/model` in-session or `soma model opus-4-7 set` from CLI. Includes adaptive thinking support.
- **`soma-dev check-upstream`** — Detect and audit Pi runtime updates. Checks changelog, extension surface, provider diffs, patch compatibility. Supports `--audit` (full analysis) and `--json` (machine-readable).
- **`soma-dev check-docs`** — Stale reference sweep across docs and website. Catches old version numbers, deprecated APIs, provider count mismatches.
- **`soma-dev check-phases`** — Verify dev cycle phase completion before release. Checks artifacts across all 10 phases. Supports `--patch` for reduced requirements.
- **`--no-context-files` / `-nc` flag** — Skip AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md loading for clean sessions without project context injection.
- **`after_provider_response` extension hook** — Extensions can inspect provider HTTP status and headers after each response.

### Changed
- **CLI help reorganized** — Session flags (`--model`, `--provider`, `--thinking`) now grouped under "Session Options (apply to this session only)" to distinguish from persistent project commands (`soma model`, `soma focus`).
- **Prompt caching improved** — Tool schemas now cached independently from the system prompt. Adding/removing tools no longer invalidates your entire system prompt cache (reduces cost when workspace tools connect/disconnect).
- **Fresh boot greeting** — When a preload exists but wasn't loaded (plain `soma` vs `soma inhale`), the greeting now says so explicitly and suggests `/inhale`. Prevents the agent from reading stale preloads on clean starts.

### Fixed
- **`grep` tool performance** — No longer stalls on broad searches with `context=0`.
- **`find` tool gitignore** — Nested `.gitignore` rules no longer leak across sibling directories.
- **Type safety** — Fixed `breathe.preloadStaleThreshold` type cast for Pi 0.67.6 compatibility.
- **Preload validator** — Section header matching is now fuzzy — accepts `## Next Session`, `## Next Session: Priorities`, `## Next Session: [Task Name]`, etc.
- **Protocol warm fallback** — Protocols with `description` in frontmatter now use it for warm-tier display when `breadcrumb` is absent. Most protocols already use `description` — this fix makes them visible at warm tier.
- **Template sync** — Shipped improved `_memory.md` template to all users (Traps section, phase breadcrumbs, warning-task binding guidance).
- **4 missing providers** — Kimi Coding, Minimax, Z.ai, and Vercel AI Gateway added to docs. Provider count updated from 17 to 23.

### Upgraded
- Pi runtime 0.67.1 → 0.67.6 (5 releases, 15+ fixes)

---

## [0.12.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Image budget auto-compact loop** — `checkImageBudget()` runs on a 5-second timer but `ctx.compact()` is async. The image counter wasn't reset until `onComplete`, so the next timer tick re-fired the warning and compact attempt, looping 6+ times. Added `imageCompactInFlight` guard flag.

---

## [0.12.0] — 2026-04-15 — Somaverse Edition

Soma meets the Somaverse. Your agent can now connect to somaverse.ai,
control your workspace remotely, and pair with your browser — all through
a secure relay. Data stays on your machine. The shard is just the pipe.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`soma login`** — Pair your agent with Somaverse. Creates a pairing code, opens your browser, and saves your device key. One command to connect.
- **Hub-connect extension** — Connects your agent to the Somaverse hub as a provider. Your browser pairs with it automatically. Works alongside bridge-connect (local + cloud simultaneously).
- **Workspace proxy** — All 28 workspace + browser tools work through the hub relay. Your agent controls the workspace even from a remote machine.
- **Device-key auth** — Workspace tools auto-detect hub mode when `~/.soma/device-key` exists. Routes to hub URL with Bearer auth instead of localhost.
- **28 agent tools** — 10 workspace, 10 browser, 5 AI, 2 plugin state, 1 browser_links (new).

### Architecture
- **Reverse proxy model** — The Somaverse hub relays WebSocket messages between your browser and your agent. It never stores your data — everything flows through to your machine.
- **Per-user isolation** — Device keys are Argon2-hashed. Each user’s workspace connection is paired by user_id. No cross-user access possible.
- **Modular extensions** — bridge-connect (local), hub-connect (cloud). Both run simultaneously with dedup. Add a service, add an extension.

### Security
- Device keys: 192-bit random, Argon2 hashed in DB
- Transport: WSS via Traefik + Let’s Encrypt
- Hub proxy: Bearer device_key + JWT cookie auth on every request
- CORS: restricted to somaverse.ai, somaverse.space, dev.somaverse.ai

### Fixed
- **Breathe stale warning** — disabled by default. Was firing every turn in long sessions ("28 tool calls since preload"). Now fires at most once, configurable via `breathe.preloadStaleThreshold` in settings.

---

## [0.11.4] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Script root-finding** — `_find_root()` in 10 dev scripts now checks `repos/agent/package.json` to distinguish `meetsoma/` from `repos/agent/` (both had `.soma/` and `repos/` dirs).
- **sync-docs.sh** — prefers `agent/` (dev) over `agent-stable/` (main) for Phase 5 doc sync.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Image budget** — auto-compact when screenshots accumulate. Soft notify at 8 images, hard auto-compact at 10. Counts all image sources (browser_screenshot, Read tool, user-pasted). Counter resets on compact. Visible in `/status`.
- **`imageBudget` settings** — `softAt` and `hardAt` configurable via `settings.json`. Set `hardAt: 0` to disable.
- **`breathe.maxTokens` setting** — caps the effective context window for breathe threshold calculations. Fixes breathe being dormant on 1M-context models where 50% = 500K tokens.
- **Sandbox source flags** — `soma-sandbox.sh --dev` builds and tests from dev branch. `--main` tests agent-stable. `--beta` (default) tests soma-beta. API tests default to claude-haiku-4-5.
- **14 new settings tests** — covers removed fields, new fields, multi-level inheritance, array replacement.

### Changed
- **Settings cleanup** — removed 3 never-implemented settings: `memory.flowUp`, `sessions.overwriteGuard`, `checkpoints.project.workingBranch`. Default version updated 0.6.4 → 0.11.3.

## [0.11.3] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Script description parser** — `getScriptMeta()` was parsing YAML frontmatter delimiters (`---`) as the script description. Every frontmatter-using script showed "---" in the system prompt. Parser now skips frontmatter blocks, extracts `# description:` fields, skips decorative lines, and scans 30 lines instead of 15.

### Changed
- **Docs version sweep** — 6 docs updated: stale version refs (v0.9.0→v0.11.2, v0.2.0→v0.3.3), extension table 4→8, scripts.md restructured into Bundled/Advanced/Hub sections.

## [0.11.2] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **soma-install.sh paths** — updated `products/soma` → `meetsoma/repos` references.
- **Duplicate session files in rotation boot** — rotation path embedded file hints in both greeting AND session_files template variable. Now greeting is narrative only, session_files handled by template (matching normal boot pattern from 4d8331f).
- **Triple error cascade on API failure** — three independent handlers fired on single error. Added errorHandled flag, else-if chain, gated fatal-session check.
- **False-positive billing detection removed** — `err.includes("extra usage")` matched Claude consumer error text, not actual billing issues. Pi shows raw API errors natively. Removed our pattern matching entirely.
- **Doctor fallback version** — hardcoded 0.10.0 → 0.11.1.
- **Build pipeline** — `build-dist.mjs` was reading Pi 0.64.0 from stale `repos/cli/dist`. Now reads from npm (Pi 0.67.1). Root cause of months of invisible dist/ drift.
- **Release script** — removed stale `CLI_DIST` reference; Soma brand themes were being overwritten by Pi defaults.
- **Dev-mode theme crash** — Pi's config.js resolves to `src/` when it exists. Added symlinks for theme, export-html, and assets paths.
- **Stale docs** — `repos/cli` ref in install-architecture.md.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime 0.64.0 → 0.67.1** — dist/ was stuck at Pi 0.64.0 despite package.json claiming ^0.66.1. Synced from npm. Gets stack overflow fix for long sessions (#2651), subscription auth warning, queued message flush fix.
- **Pi telemetry disabled** — set PI_TELEMETRY=0 in cli.js to prevent install ping added in Pi 0.67.1.
- **Rotation boot aligned with decomposition** — greeting no longer embeds session file hints. Consistent with normal boot path pattern.
- **Error handling** — auth-aware (OAuth vs API key). Account rate limits (real plan limit) handled separately from extra-usage classification errors (often transient). OAuth: progressive retry → warn → pause at 4th. API key: pause immediately.
- **Error display** — build-time error-sanitizer patch converts raw JSON API errors to human-readable messages. Billing errors show progressive messages. Retryable errors (overloaded, 500) pass through untouched.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`soma-dev verify upstream`** — detects dist/ vs node_modules/ drift by fingerprinting key runtime files. Prevents the 0.64→0.66 invisible drift.
- **Runtime integrity tests** — test-hygiene.sh now checks telemetry disable, boot decomposition, billing removal, error cascade flag, verify-upstream existence.
- **Release pipeline gate** — `soma-release.sh` now blocks on dist/ upstream drift detection before building.
- **Error-sanitizer** — build-time patch to Pi's display layer. Progressive billing messages, auth/model rewrites. Zero cache impact.
- **Patch manifest** — `scripts/_dev/patches/manifest.json` tracks applied dist/ patches.
- **CLI repo archived** — content merged to agent README. `meetsoma/cli` archived on GitHub.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Cache invalidation from image stripping** — removed progressive image stripping from `before_provider_request` in soma-guard. Each new screenshot changed the strip set, invalidating the entire cache ($2-3 per invalidation, $152/day on Apr 12). Image management now handled by capture-time optimization + future auto-compact.
- **Zombie sessions** — idle shutdown timer now runs independently of keepalive. Post-exhale shutdown (15 min) + absolute timeout (30 min). Previously, disabling keepalive also disabled the shutdown check.
- **Boot resume cache waste** — silent resume when no .soma files changed. Was injecting "Nothing changed" message that cost ~$1.78 in cache rewrite with zero value.
- **Keepalive on fatal errors** — kill keepalive on first-turn API failures to prevent infinite retry loops.
- **Billing notice handling** — separate billing notices from error-pause logic so keepalive isn't killed on credit warnings.
- **Pipeline** — remove `streamingBehavior` (not in Pi types), fix `focus --help` without seam.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Cache health tracking** — statusline tracks cacheRead, cacheWrite, cost per session. Alerts on cache invalidations (>50K token writes). Footer shows ✓cache / Ninv indicator.
- **Idle session detection** — auto-shutdown after configurable idle period with no user input.

### Changed
- Cache health indicator moved to statusline line 2 (line 1 was crowded).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-12

Identity overhaul + first-run experience. soul.md replaces SOMA.md as default. Minimal boot for new projects. 11 bundled scripts. Critical doctor fix.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`soma session`** — session maintenance tool. `strip-images` removes base64 image data from JSONL (16MB → 2.6MB), `list` shows all sessions with sizes, `stats` analyzes image payload.
- **test-install-flows.sh** — 36-assertion E2E test suite covering fresh init, v0.6→current upgrade, edge cases (corrupt settings, missing version, empty body/).
- **Discovery marker: `body`** — `findSomaDir()` now detects projects with only `body/soul.md` (no SOMA.md).
- **User extension preservation** — reinstall preserves user-installed extensions (bridge-connect.ts, workspace-tools.ts) alongside auth.json and models.json.
- **Extension allowlist** — configure approved extensions in settings.json, `/soma doctor` reports unlisted extensions.
- **Image payload guard** — `before_provider_request` strips old images when >15 accumulate in conversation. Prevents Anthropic many-image 2000px limit.

### Changed
- **Identity: soul.md is primary** — `initSoma` creates `body/soul.md` instead of `SOMA.md`. `ensureGlobalSoma` creates `body/soul.md` at `~/.soma/`. SOMA.md and identity.md still work as fallbacks. All docs, templates, tree diagrams updated (30+ files).
- **autoInject default: false** — new projects use `soma inhale` for intentional preload loading. Existing settings preserved on upgrade.
- **First-run minimal boot** — first session skips hot protocol/muscle injection into system prompt. Agent discovers through use.
- **Pi 0.65 migration** — `session_switch`/`session_fork` → `session_start` with `event.reason`.
- **Protocol heat-defaults reclassified** — only `breath-cycle` and `working-style` start warm. All others cold.
- **11 bundled scripts** (was 6) — added soma-body, soma-refactor, soma-reflect, soma-plans, soma-session.
- **Template single source** — `body/_public/` deleted, templates read from `templates/default/`.
- **Hub template install** — fetches soul.md → SOMA.md → identity.md, writes to body/soul.md for new projects.

### Fixed
- **Critical: semver comparison in thin-cli.js** — doctor used JS string comparison (`"0.6.2" > "0.10.0"`), so upgrades NEVER ran for any project. Added `semverCmp()` for proper numeric comparison.
- **CLI UX** — `soma help`, `soma version` now work (bare words). `soma init` when .soma/ exists routes to doctor instead of broken TUI.
- **Image payload guard** — strips old images from conversation history, pauses keepalive on 400/invalid_request errors (was only 429). Prevents infinite retry deadlock.
- **Parent chain detection** — init.ts walker now checks `body/soul.md` and `settings.json`, not just `SOMA.md`/`identity.md`.
- **soma verify crash** — `${*}` with `set -u` caused unbound variable when called without args.
- **Stale refs sweep** — 30+ files across docs, core, templates, scripts, community. `identity.md` → `body/soul.md` in all user-facing strings.
- **Script path leaks** — soma-health, soma-verify, soma-seam, soma-refactor guarded behind path existence checks.
- **Sandbox** — was creating `identity.md` (deprecated), now creates `body/soul.md`.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-10

Restructure release. AMPS consolidated, CLI script routing, Pi runtime bumped, 25 commits since v0.9.0.

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **v0.8.1→v0.9.0 migration map** — settings additions (inherit, keepalive, heat.autoDetectBump), script routing syntax, AMPS consolidation notes. Chains with existing migration maps.
- **soma-health.sh** — project health dashboard script.
- **Docker sandbox** — `soma-sandbox.sh` can now use Docker for isolated E2E testing (21/21 tests pass).
- **test-hygiene.sh** — repo cleanliness checks (secrets, sessions, dev artifacts).
- **verify-amps command** — CWD path resolution, community protocol source validation.
- **3 scripts promoted to bundled** — soma-verify.sh, soma-refactor.sh, soma-browser.sh moved from dev to discoverable.

### Changed
- **Pi runtime 0.64.0 → 0.66.1** — 2 minor versions, bug fixes, no breaking changes.
- **Docs: CLI syntax** — all 8 doc files updated from `soma-code.sh` to `soma code` syntax. Website synced.
- **Scripts reorganized** — 39 dev scripts moved to `_dev/`, 3 promoted to bundled, redundant scripts archived.
- **CWD safety audit** — dev-path guards on Tier 2 scripts, soma-query demoted to `_dev/`.

### Fixed
- **soma-guard: orphaned tool_result sanitizer** — `before_provider_request` handler removes orphaned tool_result blocks before API call. Prevents 400 errors from upstream Pi bug.
- **soma-statusline: auto-pause keepalive on rate limit** — detects 429/rate_limit errors, auto-disables keepalive. Prevented 67+ wasted requests per rate-limit window.
- **soma-doctor.sh: follow core/ symlink** — was reading stale `~/.soma/agent/package.json` (v0.6.0) instead of following symlink to dev repo. Now resolves through readlink.
- **init.ts: read version from package.json** — was hardcoded to 0.6.2, now reads dynamically.
- **Sandbox: deterministic prompt template test** — replaced LLM-dependent test with file-read verification.
- **Sandbox: extension/protocol count comparison** — use `>=` instead of `==` for forward compatibility.
- **soma-boot: streamingBehavior on all sendUserMessage calls** — 10 calls patched, prevents runtime errors.
- **Keepalive infinite loop** — `keepaliveInFlight` flag prevents auto-exhale from re-triggering keepalive.
- **CI: npm ci + tsx PATH** — added to all test suites for clean CI runs.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`{{inbox_summary}}` template variable** — scans `.soma/inbox/` at boot, injects unread message summary into system prompt. File-based async messaging between agents.
- **`{{scripts_table}}` in default `_mind.md`** — agents can now see their discovered scripts in the system prompt.
- **`preload.autoInject` setting** — auto-inject most recent preload on fresh boot (default: true). No longer requires `soma inhale` CLI command for preload loading.
- **7 new documentation pages** — `inbox.md`, `doctor.md`, `hub.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `guides/daily-workflow.md`, `guides/customization.md`, `guides/first-protocol.md`. Total: 33 pages (~36K words).
- **`inter-agent-inbox` community protocol** — published to community hub. Formal spec for file-based inter-agent messaging.
- **Script drift detection** — `soma-verify.sh drift` now checks scripts across agent repo → working copies → global.

### Changed
- **Digest → TL;DR migration complete** — 96 files converted from `<!-- digest:start/end -->` to `## TL;DR`. Both formats still accepted, `## TL;DR` is the standard going forward.
- **Docs accuracy overhaul** — 13 existing pages updated: `autoInject` mental model, version refs, `breadcrumb` → `description`, `maxTokens` default, session log naming format, identity.md deprecated.

### Fixed
- **Keepalive limit not enforcing** — keepalive-triggered turns reset the ping counter, making keepalives infinite. Now tracks `keepaliveInFlight` flag to skip reset on self-initiated turns.
- **Changelog hook targets [0.12.2] — 2026-04-17 only** — old hook appended to first `### Added`/`### Fixed` globally, which could hit released versions.
- **Test suite** — added `tsx` to devDependencies (bare `tsx` calls failed), fixed 10 stale test paths (`body/public` → `body/_public`, `identity.md` → `SOMA.md`).
- **Stale `body/public` references** — updated to `body/_public` across comments, docs, templates, and scripts (6 files).

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **Unified warm content format** — `## TL;DR` replaces `<!-- digest:start/end -->` across all AMPS. Protocols, muscles, and automations all use the same format. Code accepts both during transition.
- **`extractTldr()`** — shared utility for extracting TL;DR sections, used by protocols, muscles, and automations.
- **MAP = automation alias** — `map` accepted as type alias in `/hub install`, `/hub fork`, `/hub share`. MAPs are a type of automation.
- **Discovery unification** — `discoverMaps()` now scans `amps/automations/` root alongside `maps/` subdirectories. Installed hub automations are visible as MAPs.
- **Keepalive limits** — 5 pings per idle period (configurable 0–5), countdown in notification (`♥ Keepalive 3/5`), resets on user message.
- **Auto-exhale on idle** — when keepalive lives are exhausted and context exceeds 75k tokens, the agent automatically writes a preload. Configurable via `keepalive.autoExhale` and `keepalive.autoExhaleMinTokens`.
- **Migration phase `v0.8.0→v0.8.1`** — Tier 1 auto-converts muscle digest blocks to TL;DR format, adds keepalive settings.

### Changed
- **`soma-doctor.sh`** — reads agent version from `package.json` instead of hardcoded string.
- **Hub validator** — accepts `description`/`triggers`/`tags`, prefers `## TL;DR` over `<!-- digest -->`, warns on legacy format.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **`soma doctor`** — project health check and migration from CLI. Tier 1 auto-fixes (settings, body, protocols) run silently on every boot. TUI `/soma doctor` provides interactive Tier 2+ migration with `compareTemplates()` analysis.
- **`soma status` / `soma health`** — quick project health check (renamed from old `soma doctor`).
- **`soma --version`** — shows both agent and CLI versions.
- **`soma --help`** — delegates to core agent for full branded help output.
- **Migration phase system** — `cycle.md` + 9 phase files covering v0.6.1 → v0.8.0. Each phase is self-contained with from/to versions, actions, and what changed. Complete chain with no gaps.
- **`_doctor-update.md` + `_doctor-pending.md`** — boot templates for agent-assisted migration. Pending template injected into followUp when updates available.
- **`compareTemplates()`** — three-category file diff (content files, metadata, runtime) for doctor analysis.
- **`findChildSomaDirs()`** — walks filesystem to discover child `.soma/` directories for multi-project support.
- **`doctor.autoUpdate` + `declinedVersion`** — per-project settings controlling update notification behavior.
- **Warm AMPS** — skill loader shows full TL;DR or digest for warm content, short description for cold. All AMPS types unified.
- **Body templates** — improved starters for soul.md, voice.md, journal.md, pulse.md, body.md. DNA.md rewrite with self-awareness, owner’s manual, and deep reference links.
- **`_first-breath.md`** — context-aware first-run template with conditional blocks for monorepos, blank projects, code projects, global/inherited `.soma/`.
- **Test suites** — `test-doctor.sh` (46 tests), `test-migrations.sh` (48 tests) covering all doctor features and migration chain integrity.
- **Docs** — `updating.md` (migration guide), `install-architecture.md` (CLI → agent flow), `body.md` (full body architecture reference with variables, templates, chain, lifecycle).

### Changed
- **CLI routing overhaul** — `doctor`, `status`, `health`, `update`, `version` all route through thin-cli. `--help` delegates to core when agent is installed.
- **Starter content** — code fallbacks synced to `_public/` templates, HTML comments stripped from shipped content.
- **Bundled scripts** — `soma-theme.sh` seeds on init, breadcrumbs added to all bundled scripts for docs and community references.
- **`_first-breath.md`** — added self-exploration guidance (agent reads its own docs), breath cycle explanation, learn-the-user prompts.
- **`_memory.md`** — added Step 1.5 (update living docs), Before You Start (conditional loading), corrections emphasis.

### Fixed
- **CHANGELOG auto-append bug** — post-commit hook was appending to every section, not just [0.12.2] — 2026-04-17. Rewrote hook, cleaned 172 duplicate entries.
- **Boot version-bump race** — version was bumped before notification, causing re-check loops. Now bumps after Tier 1 fixes complete.
- **CLI help header** — shows "CLI v0.2.0" instead of bare version number.
- **Dev mode health check** — no longer reports false "git repo has issues" in development.
- **Tier 1 body scaffold** — adds missing body files to existing `body/` directory (was only creating on fresh init).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.

Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **`soma --help` rewrite** — Soma-branded help with session commands, project commands, options, and TUI slash commands. Replaces generic Pi help output.
- **`soma --help scripts`** — show installed scripts with descriptions. Works from CLI and inside sessions.
- **`soma --help commands`** — full command reference organized by category (CLI, session, heat, hub, info).
- **`soma-theme.sh` bundled** — shared script theming now seeds on init (was a missing dependency for 3 bundled scripts).

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **Scripts crash on fresh projects** — `source soma-theme.sh` with `set -e` caused fatal exit when theme file wasn't present. Fixed with `if [ -f ]; then source; fi` pattern across all 8 scripts.
- **`soma focus <keyword>` didn't start session** — `main()` call wasn't awaited, `process.exit(0)` ran before session could start.
- **`postinstall.js` missing from builds** — deleted during Pi 0.64.0 dist sync, restored to CLI repo. Added to `OUR_DIST_FILES` and release script.
- **Docs: `/inhale` vs `soma inhale` confusion** — commands.md and getting-started.md now clearly distinguish CLI commands (shell) from TUI slash commands, with comparison table.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.

- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard** — warns when no preload exists (suggests `/exhale`), warns when preload is stale (>5 tool calls since write). Use `/inhale --force` to override.
- **Slash command usage hints** — 10 commands now include `Usage:` patterns in their descriptions: `/pin`, `/kill`, `/auto-commit`, `/inhale`, `/install`, `/auto-breathe`, `/hub`, `/scratch`, `/keepalive`, `/soul-space`, `/soma`.
- **Hub: 5 new scripts** — soma-seam, soma-reflect, soma-query, soma-focus, soma-plans. All with coaching-voice digests.
- **Hub: soma-code v2.0.0** — added `blast` (blast radius analysis), `tsc-errors` (TypeScript errors with context), improved `refs` (DEF/IMP/USE), improved `find` (extension filter).
- **Scripts docs** — `scripts.md` rewritten with hub links for each script.

### Changed
- **Upstream sync R4** — Pi 0.63.1 → 0.64.0. New APIs: `setHiddenThinkingLabel`, `signal`/`getSignal`, `prepareArguments`, async `getArgumentCompletions`.
- **Core scripts trimmed** — init seeds 5 core scripts (soma-code, soma-seam, soma-focus, soma-update-check, validate-content). Others available via `soma hub install script <name>`.
- **Semver discipline** — feature releases now bump minor version (0.X.0). Patch (0.x.Y) reserved for bug-fix-only releases.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **Changelog hook** — `soma-dev.sh` post-commit hook now targets only the first `### Added`/`### Fixed` section (was appending to all version sections).
- **Hub table rendering** — markdown tables in hub detail pages now render with proper `<table>`/`<thead>`/`<tbody>` structure.
- **Community CI clean** — 21 frontmatter fixes across protocols and muscles (missing breadcrumb, tier, license, author, version fields).
- **Script drift** — 7 scripts synced from working copies to agent repo (soma-code v1→v2, soma-reflect, soma-seam, soma-scrape, soma-spell, soma-plans, soma-query).
- **Hub scripts sanitized** — private paths (Gravicity, vault) stripped from soma-seam.sh.

Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **`/soma doctor`** — migration command. Detects version mismatch on boot, prompts to run migration script with confirmation, shows output, reloads settings. Post-migration guidance for body file review.
- **Boot migration check** — notifies when project `.soma/` version is behind agent version.
- **Global vs parent detection** — `detectProjectContext()` distinguishes `~/.soma/` (global runtime) from real parent workspaces. Init prompt has three-way messaging: real parent choice, global fallback, or no soma.
- **Monorepo-aware first breath** — detects multi-repo projects, lists sub-projects with detected stacks. Points agent to `soma-code.sh structure` for orientation.
- **First-breath tool hints** — all first-breath messages include `soma-code.sh` and `soma-seam.sh` usage examples.
- **Body template scaffolding** — `body.md` (Project, Structure, Workflow, Current Focus sections) and `voice.md` (Delivery, Tone, Rhythm sections) ship with header scaffolding and comment breadcrumbs.
- **Richer `_memory.md`** — preload template now includes Weather, Who You Were, Orient From, Do NOT Re-Read sections.
- **Stash checkpoint style** — `checkpoints.project.style: "stash"` now wired. Uses `git stash push --include-untracked` with session ID.
- **Migration system** — `v0.6.6-to-v0.6.7.md` map + `migrate-0.6.6-to-0.6.7.sh` script. Handles settings, body templates, protocols. Backs up before replacing, skips customized files.

### Changed
- **System prompt budget** — default `systemPrompt.maxTokens` raised from 4000 to 10000. Anthropic's system prompt is ~25k; ours at ~5k was triggering false warnings.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **Preload resume false-positive** — `soma -c` no longer falsely detects preloads from previous rotations as "written this session." Uses mtime check (2-min threshold).
- **Body template instructions** — moved from frontmatter `description:` (invisible to agent) to HTML comment breadcrumbs in file body (visible, replaceable).
- **Migration script path resolution** — resolves bundled templates relative to script location, works in sandbox/dev/installed contexts.

---

## [0.6.6] — 2026-03-29

- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **Init UX** — prompt before auto-scaffolding (`ctx.ui.confirm`), parent .soma/ inheritance when user declines, `scaffoldBody` templateDir priority chain. (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)
- **Command provenance** — `/soma status` shows which extension registered each command via Pi's `sourceInfo`. (SX-233)
- **cli.js tracked source** — `src/cli.js` in agent repo is source of truth. `sync-to-cli.sh` and `soma-release.sh` use it. (SX-252)
- **Protocol coaching voice** — 14/17 protocol TL;DRs rewritten from spec/documentation voice to coaching voice. (SX-109)

### Changed
- **Upstream sync R3** — Pi 0.61.1 → 0.63.1 (71 commits, 3 releases). SourceInfo provenance, built-in tools as extensions, multi-edit, sessionDir, compaction fixes. 0 breaking changes on our imports. (SX-230)
- **Stale branches cleaned** — deleted `feat/docs-system`, `feat/runtime` (archived to patches), `protocol-quality-pass`, `feature/ship-breath-cycle`. Agent repo: dev + main + backup only.
- **scaffoldBody** priority chain: templateDir → bundled `_public/` → bundled `body/`.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- `/soma prompt` diagnostic checked for "Learned Patterns" but actual heading is "Muscle Memory".

- **`/soma preload`** (in-session) — enhanced to list all preloads + inject by partial name match.
- **`listPreloads()`** + **`findPreloadByName()`** in `core/preload.ts` — preload discovery and partial name matching.
- **Settings-driven heat overrides** (`settings.heat.overrides`) — per-project AMPS heat control. Values act as both seed and decay floor. Plan/MAP overrides take priority. (`31e1383`)
- **`inherit.automations`** — separate from tools inheritance, allows projects to opt out of parent MAPs independently. (`3f01343`)
- **Statusline preload indicator** — shows preload status in footer. Smart `/exhale` detects edit vs write mode. (`76cd246`)
- **Auto-archive stale preloads** after exhale — `archiveStalePreloads()` moves old preloads to `_archive/`. (`7f2f086`)
- **Restart signal** — auto-create `.restart-required` on extension/core file changes, check across full soma chain. Signal moved to `~/.soma/` (global). (`14d0253`, `635d36e`, `e252a63`)

### Changed
- **`--preload` flag deprecated** — shows warning pointing to `soma inhale` or `soma map`. Still works for backward compat.
- **Boot greeting decomposed** — session ID and file paths now separate template variables. (`4d8331f`)

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **Crash on partial settings** — `settings.heat.overrides` access without optional chaining crashed when `heat` section missing. Now defensive. (`b837a37`)
- **Breathe graceSeconds mismatch** — runtime fallback was 60s, settings default was 30s. Aligned to 30s. (`b837a37`)
- **5 auto-breathe UX gaps** — smart context warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic for preload detection. (`0f86bec`)

## [0.6.4] — 2026-03-23

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **Body architecture** — structured identity system. `.soma/body/` with content files (`soul.md` → `{{soul}}`, `voice.md` → `{{voice}}`, `body.md` → `{{body}}`) and templates (`_mind.md`, `_memory.md`, `_boot.md`). Content files become template variables. Templates control system prompt and preload structure.
- **Template engine** (`core/body.ts`) — `{{variable}}` interpolation with 5 modifiers (`|tldr`, `|section:Name`, `|lines:N`, `|last:N`, `|ref`), conditional blocks (`{{#var}}...{{/var}}`), graceful degradation for missing vars.
- **AMPS Skill Loader** (`core/skill-loader.ts`) — unified content scanner. All AMPS classified by heat: hot (8+) = full body in prompt, warm (3-7) = `<available_skills>` XML (agent reads on demand), cold (0-2) = hidden. Claude's native skill format.
- **`/body` command** — template inspector with 4 subcommands: `check` (health report), `vars` (all variables by category), `map` (template structure), `render` (full compiled system prompt, fresh from disk).
- **Variable registry** — 50+ template variables categorized (context, identity, section, boot, session, focus, metadata, preload-tpl, deprecated) with essential flags and descriptions.
- **`SOMA.md`** replaces `identity.md` as canonical identity file. Resolution: `body/soul.md` → `SOMA.md` → `identity.md` (legacy fallback).
- **`body.md`** — project-shaped working context variable (`{{body}}`). Changes per project, placed anywhere in `_mind.md`.
- **First-breath template** — conditional blocks (`{{#has_code}}`, `{{#is_blank}}`) for first-run experience.
- **`/exit`** command — save state and quit cleanly.
- **Boot greetings** rewritten — "You woke up" not "You've booted into a session."
- **Header bar** shows soul/body status indicators.
- **`soma-verify.sh drift`** — `_public/` sync check across protocols, muscles, body files, community repo, and agent repo.
- **`systemPrompt.maxTokens`** wired as soft warning — notification when compiled prompt exceeds budget.
- **Muscle heat bumps on load** — muscles that stay relevant gain heat naturally (+1 per boot). Previously only bumped when explicitly read.
- **Body file inheritance** — content files and templates walk the soma chain (project → parent → global). Child wins on collision.
- **`user.name`**, `user.style` settings with `{{user_name}}`, `{{user_style}}` variables.

### Changed
- **System prompt** driven by `body/_mind.md` template when present. Users control structure, sections, custom text. Falls back to built-in compiler.
- **Warm AMPS** appear as `<available_skills>` XML alongside Pi native skills — Claude's trained format for lazy-loaded content.
- **`prompts/system-core.md`** — removed explicit context percentages (50/70/80/85%). Auto-breathe handles thresholds; agent shouldn't guess.
- **AMPS cleanup** — 44 → 34 active muscles (10 archived), 9 → 2 high-overlap triggers (16 cleaned), 34/34 have descriptions.
- **Docs sweep** — 9 pages updated for body architecture, SOMA.md, skill loader, template engine, removed gendered pronouns.
- **`sync-docs.sh`** manifest expanded — 10 new docs added (focus, maps, sessions, prompts, skills, settings, themes, keybindings, models, terminal-setup).
- **Protocol test** accepts `description:` alongside `breadcrumb:` (migration compat).
- **Sandbox test** updated for 8 extensions, 19 protocols, SOMA.md init.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**
- **Conversation tail injection removed** — was scanning stale Pi JSONL sessions from wrong runtime, sidetracking agent with old conversations.
- **Soul frontmatter leaking** into rendered system prompt — `loadIdentity()` now strips YAML frontmatter.
- **Duplicate `# Identity` heading** — `buildLayeredIdentity()` no longer hardcodes heading; template handles it.
- **`_public/` drift** — 22 files synced across community + agent repos. Drift detection tool built.
- **Boot message duplication** — stripped content already in system prompt from boot followUp.
- **`/body render`** compiles fresh from disk each time (was using stale boot cache).

### Internal
- **`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`** in `core/body.ts` — complete registry of all template variables with categories, essential flags, descriptions.
- **`core/skill-loader.ts`** — `LoadableContent` interface, `loadAllContent()`, `formatAsSkillsXml()`.
- **`compileWithTemplate()`** — template path in `compileFullSystemPrompt()`, shared section builders.
- **`getDefaultMindTemplate()`**, `getDefaultBootTemplate()` — built-in fallback templates.
- **`loadFirstBreath()`** — conditional first-run template with chain inheritance.
- **52 block variables** tested (77/77 body tests + 19 E2E).
- **Frontmatter-kit** — 9 scripts for bulk AMPS frontmatter operations (extract, writeback, sort, migrate, audit).
- **`preload.lastMessages`** setting removed (conversation tail scanner was the only consumer).

## [0.6.3] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **settings-driven heat overrides — per-project AMPS control**
- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**
- **`/hub` command** — unified hub interface for community content. Install, fork, share, find, list, status. Replaces old `/install` and `/list` commands (kept as backward compat aliases).
- **Smart sharing** (`/hub share`) — quality scoring (0-100%), privacy auto-fix with `_public/` staging, README generation that captures `--help` output and extracts functions, dependency resolution.
- **Drop-in commands** — scripts in `.soma/amps/scripts/commands/` become `/soma <name>` commands. Hot-loadable, no restart needed. Tab completions included.
- **`scope: core` protocols** — documentation protocols whose behavior is coded in TypeScript. Never loaded into prompt (saves ~2000 tokens). Discoverable, readable on demand via docs section. `/pin` and `/kill` block with explanation.
- **5 core protocols** — breath-cycle, heat-tracking, session-checkpoints, git-identity, hub-sharing.
- **`automation` content type** — MAPs are now installable hub content. 3 published: debug, refactor, visual-gap-analysis.
- **Dependency resolution** — `requires:` in frontmatter auto-installs dependencies (scripts, protocols, muscles) alongside content.
- **`gitIdentity.email` array support** — multiple valid emails for multi-account users.
- **Default preload template** — Weather (emotional tone) + Warnings (traps for next session) sections.
- **Preload template** on community hub — customizable preload format.
- **Regression test suite** — test-hub.sh (25 tests) + test-commands.sh (26 tests). Side-effect testing for `-p` mode.

### Changed
- **Hub: 40 items** across 5 content types (17 protocols, 8 muscles, 3 scripts, 3 automations, 9 templates).
- **`/soma prompt`** shows core protocols with 📄 icon instead of misleading heat display.
- **Bundled protocols** updated with shipped tool references (soma-code, soma-scrape, soma-spell).
- **Community CI** — validate-frontmatter accepts `triggers` (replaces `topic`+`keywords`), `description` OR `breadcrumb`. Format-check supports `scope: core`. Attribution allows org identity for owners. Actions upgraded to v6 (Node 22).

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**
- **`/hub list --remote`** — flag was parsed as type filter, returning 0 results.
- **Drop-in command output** — ANSI escape codes stripped (sendUserMessage renders markdown, not terminal).
- **Stale git-identity heat rule** removed from HEAT_RULES (protocol was archived).
- **soma-refactor.sh scan** — string references now exclude node_modules/dist/.git.

### Security
- **soma-beta** — `.map` files (128) and `.d.ts` files (64) stripped from dist. Source maps contained full `sourcesContent`.
- **soma-beta** — orphan history on every release. Old commits can't recover source code.

### Internal
- 7-phase dev cycle MAP (soma-dev/cycle.md with phase files)
- Blog content cycle MAP (blog/cycle.md with phase files)
- SVG blog diagrams muscle (Soma palette, transparent bg, rsvg-convert pipeline)
- Migration v0.6.2→v0.6.3 updated for scope:core + git-identity restore
- FRONTMATTER.md rewritten, CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- 185 unit test assertions (was 162), 51 regression tests

## [0.6.2] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **settings-driven heat overrides — per-project AMPS control**
- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**
- **Natural muscle heat detection** — muscles now heat-bump from natural use, not just focus. Script execution matches against `tools:` field. File edits match path segments against `triggers`. Zero configuration needed.
- **Migration system** — `version` field in settings.json. `core/migrations.ts` discovers and chains migration maps. `soma doctor` checks workspace health. `soma doctor --fix` auto-repairs. `soma doctor --migrate` spawns agent for complex fixes.
- **Community template sync** — boot fetches latest protocols from community repo. Bundled protocols serve as offline fallback. Add content to community → add name to template → all new users get it.
- **`tools:` field** in muscle frontmatter — declares which scripts a muscle references. Parsed and used for natural heat detection.

### Changed
- **Triggers consolidation** — `triggers` + `keywords` + `topic` merged into single `triggers` list at parse time. `tags` stays for categorization only. Old format works indefinitely (backwards compat).
- **Muscle interface simplified** — one activation list instead of four redundant fields with different score weights.
- **Personality engine** — welcome flow is honest about being templates, not the agent.

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**
- **Runtime delegation** — soma-beta now includes cli.js and Pi runtime files. Previously thin-cli fell through to raw Pi (no version skip, no auto-rotate, "Update Available" banner).
- **Fresh installs** now include version field in settings.json.
- **Stale test assertions** — test suite checked for removed frontmatter fields and nonexistent commands.

### Internal
- soma-theme.sh, soma-rebrand.sh, soma-switch.sh dev mode, soma-doctor.sh
- script-polish + github-theming muscles
- 7 repo READMEs refreshed, post-release MAP created
- License date corrected to 2027-09-18, contact standardised to meetsoma@gravicity.ai
- Dangerous CI disabled (release-publish.yml shipped full source on v* tags)

#### MAP System — Plan-Driven Agent Orchestration
- `maps.ts` — MAP discovery + prompt-config YAML parser (#1039512)
- `PlanPromptConfig` — plan-driven system prompt overrides: heat overrides, force-include/exclude, section toggles, budget overrides, supplementary identity (#28d71fe)
- `soma --map <name>` — MAP targeting via `.boot-target` signal file. Loads prompt-config, targeted preload, and MAP content as navigation context (#a12709e)
- 18 tests for MAP parser + plan override compilation (#df835cb)

#### Focus Targeting — Seam-Traced Boot
- `soma-focus.sh` — pre-model seam-traced boot priming. Traces keyword through memory, scores relevance, generates `.boot-target` with heat overrides (#116c4bb)
- Focus handler in `soma-boot.ts` — `type: "focus"` .boot-target support. Loads focus preload, related MAPs (max 3), focus summary (#2f7d302)
- Muscle trigger engine — `triggers:` frontmatter parsed and matched at boot. Muscles auto-activate when focus keyword matches their tags, keywords, topics, or explicit triggers (#1bc1c57)
- `matchMusclesToFocus()` — TypeScript-native muscle matching with scored relevance (10=trigger, 5=tag/keyword, 4=topic, 3=name, 2=digest) (#1bc1c57)
- `trackMapRun()` — programmatic MAP usage tracking. Auto-increments `runs:` and updates `last-run:` in frontmatter when MAP loads via .boot-target (#893f176)

#### Scripts — Agent Tools That Ship
- **5 Tier 1 scripts** now ship with Soma and are seeded on `soma init` (#116c4bb):
  - `soma-code.sh` — multi-language codebase navigator (map, find, refs, replace, structure, tsc-errors)
  - `soma-seam.sh` — trace concepts through memory, code, and sessions
  - `soma-focus.sh` — seam-traced boot priming
  - `soma-reflect.sh` — parse session logs for patterns and observations
  - `soma-plans.sh` — plan lifecycle management
- `scaffoldScripts()` in `init.ts` — copies bundled scripts to `.soma/amps/scripts/` on init (#116c4bb)
- `ensureGlobalSoma()` — bootstraps `~/.soma/` with AMPS layout on first boot. Seeds scripts, creates global identity template. Idempotent. (#47422e8)
- Protocol scope fix — 5 protocols changed from hub/internal to bundled for proper CLI distribution (#47422e8)
- Recursive AMPS discovery — muscles, protocols, scripts, MAPs now scan subdirectories (max 2 levels). Directories with `_` or `.` prefix are skipped. Enables organized layouts: `muscles/ui/`, `scripts/dev/`, `maps/runtime/` (#c36dcd0)
- Identity template enhanced — 5 working patterns (read-before-write, scripts-first, verify-before-claiming, corrections-as-signal, log-your-work) in both built-in and smart templates (#98035e9)
- `soma-pr.sh` moved to `_dev/` — requires GitHub App secrets users don't have (#98035e9)
- `soma-scrape.sh` — intelligent doc discovery + scraping (resolve, pull, search, discover). Requires gh, curl, jq (#18e5bde)
- `soma-query.sh` — unified search replacing soma-scan + soma-search. Commands: find, list, search, sessions, related, impact (#5604f2a)
- `/scan-logs --send` flag — injects search results into agent conversation (#1f891a5)

#### Guard & Safety
- Worktree boundary enforcement — hard-block writes outside allowed worktree path (#961f2bc)
- Soul-space command gated behind `.gate.md` file (#2b0d819)

#### Agent Infrastructure
- PR template, agent contribution standards for GitHub App bot PRs (#743b48d)
- Soul-space mode — `/soul-space on` replaces keepalive with MLR prompts (#caea905)
- TypeScript type checking (`npm run check`) + biome linting (`npm run lint`) (#20ab881)

#### Identity & Protocols
- Identity bootstrap with 4 sections: This Project, Voice, How I Work, Review & Evolve (#c5086ea)
- `response-style` protocol — set voice, length, emoji, and format preferences (#50aee8a)
- Dignity clause in `correction-capture` — acknowledge without over-apologizing (#50aee8a)
- `maps` protocol — teaches MAP system: check before tasks, build after repeated processes (#4a85b53)
- `plan-hygiene` protocol — plan lifecycle: status tracking, ≤12 active budget, verify before claiming (#4a85b53)
- `soma inhale` CLI subcommand — fresh session with preload from last session (#f61064f)
- `soma` (no args) now starts clean — no preload injection (#f61064f)
- User interrupt detection during auto-breathe — 1st interrupt resets timer, 2nd cancels (#d530af8)
- Gum-formatted `--help` output with tables and styled header (cli)

### Changed
- Pi runtime upgraded 0.60.0 → 0.61.0 — full upstream sync (Release Round 2), 76 upstream commits (#de7bd1c)
- `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` + `SOMA_CODING_AGENT_DIR` env vars — correct path delegation for .soma/ project dirs (#5c9ba4d, #f5818a6)
- `system-core.md` updated — scripts-first workflow, tool-building guidance, session logging format, preload coaching, verify-before-claiming (#116c4bb)
- `tool-discipline.md` v3.0.0 — script-first workflow, when to build scripts, script standards (#116c4bb)
- `soma-breathe.ts` extracted from `soma-boot.ts` — cleaner separation of concerns (#aa4ae19)
- Protocol quality-standards expanded — close-the-loop, tests-match-code, conventional commits (#d2dc95d)
- Preload quality added to breath-cycle TL;DR (#0632fad)
- Author attribution + CC BY 4.0 license footers on protocols (#0a2e0ac)

## [0.5.2] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**

- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**

- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**

- Auto-breathe mode — proactive context management that triggers wrap-up at configurable %, auto-rotates at higher %. Safety net at 85% always on. Opt-in via `breathe.auto` in settings (#1d533bf)
- `/auto-breathe` command — runtime toggle (`on|off|status`), persists to settings.json
- Smarter `/breathe` — context-aware instructions (light/full/urgent), handles preload-already-written and timeout edge cases
- Cold-start muscle boost — muscles created <48h get +3 effective heat for at least 2 sessions
- Orient-from preloads — preload template includes `## Orient From` pointing to files next session should read first
- `soma:recall` event signal — extensions can listen for context pressure events (steno integration)

- `sync-to-cli.sh` and `sync-to-website.sh` — one-command repo sync scripts
- `soma-compat.sh` — detect protocol/muscle overlap, redundancy, directive conflicts
- `soma-update-check.sh` — compare local protocol/muscle versions against hub
- `/scratch` command — quick notes to `.soma/scratchpad.md`, append-only, agent doesn't see unless `/scratch read`
- `guard.bashCommands` setting — `allow`/`warn`/`block` for dangerous bash command prompts
- Automations system — `.soma/automations/` for step-by-step procedural flows
- Polyglot script discovery — boot discovers `.sh`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.mjs` scripts with auto-extracted descriptions

- Git hooks: `post-commit` auto-changelog + `pre-push` docs-drift nudge
- Bundled protocols: `correction-capture` + `detection-triggers` — learning-agent protocols

### Changed

- Config-first script extensions — `settings.scripts.extensions` controls which file types are discovered

- CI improvements — PR check and release workflows now run all test suites

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**

- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**

- System prompt dropped after turn 1 — Pi resets each `before_agent_start`, now caches compiled prompt
- Identity never in compiled prompt — `isPiDefaultPrompt()` checked wrong string
- Context warnings never fired — `getContextUsage()` returns undefined on turn 1, handled gracefully
- Identity lost after `/auto-continue` or `/breathe` — `session_switch` now rebuilds from chain
- Guard false positive on `2>/dev/null` — stderr redirects no longer trigger write warnings
- Bash guard false positive on `>>` — append redirects no longer trigger dangerous redirect guard
- Preload auto-injected on continue/resume — `soma -c` and `soma -r` no longer inject stale preloads
- `/soma prompt` crash — `getProtocolHeat` import missing
- Audit false positives — all 11 audit scripts improved across the board

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added
- **System prompt budget guardrail — `maxTokens: 17000`** (s01-639c5f). Project-level setting warns when compiled prompt exceeds 17K tokens, enforcing lean-body discipline.
- **State-disk sync muscle** (s01-639c5f). Documents the `state.json` drift pattern — when files are moved to `_archive/` or deleted, JSON entries persist as ghosts. Proposed boot-time fix: prune entries for non-existent files during discovery.
- **soma-workspace-migrate-legacy.sh — lazy migration W2 of plan 02 (s01-680a9c, preload #3)** — walks `~/.soma/plugins/<type>/state.json` and copies each into `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/<type>/<type>-1.json` + registers in `~/.soma/workspaces/__legacy__/panes.json`. Idempotent (re-run skips already-registered instances). Skips leading-underscore types (`_test`, `_regression_test`) by default. Preserves old paths for one release cycle as fallback. Per `02-workspace-pane-config.md § Migration W2 (lazy)` and `~/.soma/workspaces/README.md`. Smoke-verified end-to-end against a tmp clone of `~/.soma/plugins/`: 8 panes migrated, registry built with types/paths/timestamps/provenance markers, re-run skipped all 8.
- **rewrite DNA.md — self-awareness, owner's manual, link to docs for deep reference**
- **/inhale guard + stale warning, slash command usage hints**
- **prompt before auto-init + parent inheritance (SX-164, SX-165, SX-241)**
- **show command provenance in /soma status (SX-233)**
- **track cli.js as source in agent repo (SX-252)**
- **settings-driven heat overrides — per-project AMPS control**
- **inherit.automations — separate from tools inheritance**
- **statusline preload indicator + smart /exhale (edit vs write)**
- **auto-archive stale preloads after exhale + archiveStalePreloads()**

- Compiled system prompt ("Frontal Cortex") — `core/prompt.ts` assembles complete system prompt from identity chain, protocol summaries, muscle digests, dynamic tool section
- Session-scoped preloads — `preload-<sessionId>.md` prevents multi-terminal conflicts
- Identity in system prompt — moved from boot user message for better token caching
- Parent-child inheritance — `inherit: { identity, protocols, muscles, tools }` in settings
- Persona support — `persona: { name, emoji, icon }` for named agent instances
- Smart init — `detectProjectContext()` scans for parent `.soma/`, `CLAUDE.md`, project signals
- `systemPrompt` settings — toggle docs, guard, CLAUDE.md awareness in system prompt assembly
- `prompts/system-core.md` — static behavioral DNA skeleton
- Debug mode — `.soma/debug/` logging, `/soma debug on|off`
- Protocol graduation — heat decay floor, frontmatter enforcement, preload quality validation
- Configurable boot sequence — `settings.boot.steps` array
- Git context on boot — `git-context` step injects recent commits and changed files
- Configurable context warnings — `settings.context` thresholds

### Changed

- Extension ownership refactor — `soma-boot.ts` owns lifecycle + commands, `soma-statusline.ts` owns rendering + keepalive
- Boot user message trimmed — identity, protocol breadcrumbs, and muscle digests moved to system prompt
- CLAUDE.md awareness, not adoption — system prompt notes existence but doesn't inject content

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**
- **restore walk-up, keep .soma-only + runtime-home skip**
- **findSomaDir checks current dir only, no walk-up**
- **only .soma/ is a valid soma root, not .claude/ or .cursor/**
- **skip global runtime home in findSomaDir walk-up**
- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**

- Print-mode race condition — `ctx.hasUI` guard on `sendUserMessage` in `session_start`
- Skip scaffolding core extensions into project `.soma/extensions/`
- Template placeholder substitution on install

- 10 test suites with 255 passing tests
- Workspace scripts — `soma-scan.sh`, `soma-search.sh`, `soma-snapshot.sh`, `soma-tldr.sh`

### Changed

- Bundled protocols slimmed from all to 4 core (breath-cycle, heat-tracking, session-checkpoints, pattern-evolution)

### Fixed
- **help header shows 'CLI v...' not bare version**
- **help rewrite, script theme crash, focus session, postinstall, docs**

- **defensive settings.heat access + stale test mocks — 567/567 pass**
- **5 UX gaps — smart warnings, resume awareness, write heuristic**

- PII scrubbed from git history across all repos
- CLI stripped to distribution only — agent is source of truth
