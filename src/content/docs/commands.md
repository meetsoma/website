# Commands

<!-- tldr -->
`/inhale` — load preload into current session. `/breathe` — save + auto-continue. `/exhale` — save + stop. `/rest` — disable keepalive + exhale (going to bed). `/pin <name>` — bump heat +5. `/kill <name>` — drop heat to 0. `/install <type> <name>` — install from hub. `/list local|remote` — browse content. `/soma` — status + management (subcommands: `init`, `prompt`, `preload`, `debug`). `/scratch <note>` — quick notes to scratchpad. `/auto-breathe on|off` — toggle proactive context rotation. `/auto-commit on|off` — toggle .soma/ auto-commit. `/route` — show extension capability router status. CLI: `soma` (fresh), `soma -c` (continue).
<!-- /tldr -->

Soma registers slash commands that control the breath cycle, heat system, and session management.

## Session Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/inhale` | Start a fresh session. Shows preload status and suggests `soma -c` to continue with context. |
| `/breathe` | Save state and auto-continue into a fresh session. Seamless rotation — exhale + inhale in one motion. |
| `/exhale` | Save state to disk. Writes `preload-next-<date>-<id>.md` to `memory/preloads/`, saves heat state with decay for unused content. Session ends. |
| `/rest` | Going to bed? Disables cache keepalive, then exhales. No pings will fire after you walk away. |

## Heat Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pin <name>` | Pin a protocol or muscle — bumps its heat by the configured `pinBump` (default: +5). Keeps it loaded in future sessions. |
| `/kill <name>` | Drop a protocol or muscle's heat to zero. It won't load until used again. |

## Hub Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/install <type> <name>` | Install a protocol, muscle, skill, or template from the Soma Hub. Templates resolve dependencies automatically. Use `--force` to overwrite. |
| `/list local [type]` | Show installed content in your `.soma/`. Optionally filter by type (protocol, muscle, skill, template). |
| `/list remote [type]` | Browse available content on the hub. Fetches from `meetsoma/community` on GitHub. |

## Guard Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/guard-status` | Show guard statistics: reads tracked, directories listed, interventions blocked. Provided by `soma-guard.ts` extension. |

## Debug Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/route` | Show the extension capability router — registered capabilities (provider, description) and signal listeners. Useful for debugging inter-extension communication. Provided by `soma-route.ts`. |

## Info & Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/soma` | Show Soma status — loaded identity, protocol heat states, muscle states, context usage. |
| `/soma init` | Create a `.soma/` directory in the current project. |
| `/soma prompt` | Preview the compiled system prompt — shows all assembled sections, token estimate, and which toggles are active. |
| `/soma prompt full` | Dump the full compiled system prompt text. |
| `/soma prompt identity` | Show identity debug — chain, layering, char count. |
| `/soma preload` | Show available preload files (name, age, staleness). |
| `/soma debug on\|off` | Toggle debug logging to `.soma/debug/`. |
| `/status` | Show session stats — context usage, turn count, uptime. Provided by `soma-statusline.ts`. |

## User Tools

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/scratch <note>` | Append a quick note to `.soma/scratchpad.md`. The agent doesn't see it — it's your private notepad. |
| `/scratch read` | Show the scratchpad contents to the agent. |
| `/scratch clear` | Empty the scratchpad. |

## Toggle Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/auto-breathe on\|off` | Toggle auto-breathe mode — proactive context management. Wraps up at configurable %, auto-rotates before 85%. Rotation uses the capability router when available, or CLI process restart as fallback. Default: off. |
| `/auto-commit on\|off` | Toggle auto-commit of `.soma/` state on exhale/breathe. Default: on. |
| `/keepalive on\|off` | Toggle cache keepalive. When enabled, sends periodic pings to prevent cache eviction during idle periods. |

## Context Warnings

Soma monitors context usage and warns at configurable thresholds:

| Setting | Default | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `context.notifyAt` | 50% | Gentle note: "Context halfway" |
| `context.urgentAt` | 80% | Strong suggestion to exhale soon (injected into prompt) |
| `context.autoExhaleAt` | 85% | Auto-exhale triggers — state saves, session rotates |

Override in `settings.json` — see [Configuration](configuration.md#context-warnings).

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `soma` | Fresh session — loads identity, hot protocols, active muscles |
| `soma -c` | Continue — loads everything above + last session's preload |
| `soma -r` | Resume — pick from previous sessions to restore |

## Scripts

Soma ships standalone bash scripts in the agent's `scripts/` directory. These run outside the agent session — useful for auditing, snapshotting, and pre-commit hooks.

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `soma-audit.sh` | Ecosystem health check — runs focused audits (PII, drift, stale content, docs sync, command consistency). `--list` to see audits, or name specific audits to run. |
| `soma-snapshot.sh` | Rolling zip snapshots of project directories. |
| `frontmatter-date-hook.sh` | Git pre-commit hook — auto-updates `updated:` field in modified `.md` files. |

```bash
# Examples
scripts/soma-audit.sh --list         # see available audits
scripts/soma-audit.sh drift pii      # run specific audits
scripts/soma-snapshot.sh . "pre-refactor"
```

## The Breath Cycle

Commands map to Soma's breath metaphor:

1. **Inhale** — session starts, boot steps run in order (identity → preload → protocols → muscles → scripts → git-context). Configurable in [Configuration](configuration.md#boot-sequence).
2. **Work** — the session. Heat shifts based on what you use.
3. **Breathe** — context filling up? `/breathe` saves state and continues seamlessly.
4. **Exhale** — done for now? `/exhale` saves state and ends the session.
5. **Rest** — going to bed? `/rest` disables keepalive pings and exhales. No cache pings will fire after you walk away.

See [How It Works](/docs/how-it-works) for the full breath cycle explanation.
